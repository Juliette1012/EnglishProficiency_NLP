<A>Now, O K, <SC>I</SC> we'll do a role play.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>And, please read this card. And, when you're ready, I'll start.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K, I'm ready.</B>
<A>Ready? O K. <F>Ah</F>. Hello. May I help you?</A>
<B>Yes, <SC>I must</SC> <F>ah</F> I said that I was <F>ah</F> <v_fml odr="1" crr="joining">joined</v_fml> your <F>ah</F> tour, and it advertised many things with <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> lots of gorgeous <F>ah</F> services. But, when I actually experienced the tour, after the tour and <prp_cmp odr="1" crr="during that">during</prp_cmp>, <con_lxc odr="2" crr="">and</con_lxc> <pn_lxc odr="3" crr="I"></pn_lxc> <v_lxc odr="4" crr="found"></v_lxc> there were some <F>ah</F> differences <prp_lxc2 odr="5" crr="between">with</prp_lxc2> your <SC>exp</SC> advertisement and <at odr="6" crr="the"></at> actual tour. And, maybe, I hope to be <SC>comsen</SC> compensated <SC>with</SC> <o_lxc odr="1" crr="in some way">in some kind of form</o_lxc>.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. O K. At the moment, I'm afraid I can do nothing for you.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Umm</F>. But, could you explain more about your problem?</A>
<B>Yes, it was a cruise around the world. And <SC>I said</SC> they said we could experience lots of <R>si</R> <F>ah</F> <n_cnt odr="1" crr="sightseeing">sightseeings</n_cnt> without <aj_lxc odr="2" crr="additional">optional</aj_lxc> fee. But, actually, <SC>your schedule</SC> the trip schedule was a little bit tight. And we <v_ng odr="2" crr="didn't have"><v_tns odr="1" crr="had">have</v_tns> not</v_ng> <aj_qnt odr="3" crr="many">much</aj_qnt> options to look out during our stay in the course. So, compared with your <SC>as</SC> advertisement <SC?>to</SC?>, we cannot understand why the service was so poor and different <prp_lxc2 odr="1" crr="from">with</prp_lxc2> your <aj_lxc odr="2" crr="original">original's</aj_lxc> plan.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. But, why didn't <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="you"></pn_lxc> tell your problem to <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> tour conductor?</A>
<B>Yes, we did. And <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> tour conductor <v_tns odr="2" crr="suggested">was suggesting</v_tns> we ask <F>ah</F> <at odr="3" crr="the"></at> <o_lxc odr="4" crr="travel agency">tour agency</o_lxc> <prp_lxc2 odr="5" crr="about">for</prp_lxc2> the problem afterwards, and <pn_lxc odr="6" crr="you">they</pn_lxc> <v_tns odr="7" crr="would do">will <F>ah</F> do</v_tns> something for us to compensate <SC>our services</SC> <prp_lxc2 odr="8" crr="for"></prp_lxc2> <pn_lxc odr="9" crr="your">their</pn_lxc> services.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. O K. Anyway, <SC>I'm</SC> we're very sorry for that. And, O K, I'll give you <F>ah</F> a coupon for your next trip.</A>
<B><F>Um-hm</F>.</B>
<A><SC>You are so</SC> please use this coupon for your next trip.</A>
<B><F>Ahh</F>. Yes, but, because <SC>we were so <SC>look</SC> looking</SC> we were so looking forward to this plan, this was our long awaited plan to <F>ah</F> travel around <SC>with</SC> by ship. And we don't have <F>ah</F> future <n_lxc odr="1" crr="plans">prospects</n_lxc> for next long vacation, yes.</B>
<A>I'm sorry. I understand <SC>you</SC> what you said. <F>Ah</F>. I'm very sorry. <F>Ahh</F>. But, after your travel, we can't do anything for you. I'm sorry. So, please <F>ah</F> accept this coupon.</A>
<B><F>Um-hm</F>. O K.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Is it O K?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. Yes. What <mo_lxc odr="1" crr="have"></mo_lxc> <mo_lxc odr="2" crr="been"></mo_lxc> done <v_tns odr="3" crr="cannot be">couldn't be</v_tns> <v_lxc odr="4" crr="helped">done</v_lxc>, so O K.</B>
