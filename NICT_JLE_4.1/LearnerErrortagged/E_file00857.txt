<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F>.</B>
<A><F>Er</F> that sounds nice. <F>Ah</F> what about on weekends? Do you do anything special?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>er</F> recently I go to <F>er</F> <.></.> school <SC>which is</SC> <F>mm</F> where I can learn business skills, presentations or communication skills. <F>Um</F>.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F> can you tell me a little bit more about classes?</A>
<B><F>Ahm</F> <F>uum</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>ah</F> <.></.> <F>mm</F> there are two types of classes. And <SC>one is</SC> <F>um</F> as I told you, one is <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="on"></prp_lxc1> presentation and the other one is <F>ah</F> <prp_lxc1 odr="2" crr="on"></prp_lxc1> business communication skills. So <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="in">at</prp_lxc1> <.></.> <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> presentation course, I have to prepare some materials to present <F>ah</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> in front of <o_odr odr="3" crr="all the students">the all students</o_odr>. And <nvs>cough</nvs> it's hard to do in front of people, but it's interesting. And <F>um</F> the other one <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="on"></prp_lxc1> <nvs>cough</nvs> business skills is mostly <prp_lxc1 odr="2" crr="about"></prp_lxc1> communication skill. So, <F>uum</F> when <.></.> we talk to each other, <F>uhm</F> there <v_agr odr="1" crr="are">is</v_agr> <R>s</R> some <n_num odr="2" crr="kinds">kind</n_num> of <n_num odr="3" crr="roles">role</n_num>.

<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><.></.> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. When do you find your classes or course helpful at work?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> yes, I found it very helpful. <SC>I'm taking</SC> <F>ah</F> I'm still taking that course, so <.></.> <F>mm</F> I cannot <R>do</R> do <F>well</F> what I <v_vo odr="1" crr="have learned"><?>have been</?> learned</v_vo> in the class. But <.></.> <F>um</F> already I can tell some <n_num odr="1" crr="parts">part</n_num> of me <.></.> <F>un</F> <v_agr odr="2" crr="were">was</v_agr> changed.

I couldn't say no, but recently I can somehow negotiate.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>oh</F> that's good. I see. O K, thank you.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>Now <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> first thing, let me show you a picture. <.></.> Please describe this picture.</A>
<B>Yes. <nvs>cough</nvs> this is a picture of a class. There are <F>ahm</F> <.></.> six students in this class. The teacher is a woman, and she seems to <.></.> be a mathematic teacher <.></.> in a mathematic <R>c</R> class. Those students are not so interested in mathematics, so <nvs>cough</nvs> some are <.></.> chatting, some are listening <prp_lxc2 odr="1" crr="to"></prp_lxc2> music and drinking. <.></.> And one man is <F>er</F> chewing <.></.> gum, but <F>er</F> there are two students who are enthusiastic about this class.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> O K, thank you.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Ah</F> can you compare this classroom <F>err</F> to your classroom in high school?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F> <F>ahm</F> <.></.> <F>hum</F> <F>hum</F> <.></.> when I was a high school student, our class was <.></.> mostly <nvs>cough</nvs> not like this. <nvs>laughter</nvs> But <R>we were</R> <.></.> <F>um</F> we were <.></.> more <.></.> <F>um</F> enthusiastic, I think. But <F>uum</F> <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="in"></prp_lxc1> some classes like English conversation class, we were not <R>so</R> <F>uum</F> so happy, so <.></.> we were not <.></.> <F>um</F> interested in what <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> teacher <R>was</R> was saying. <.></.> So we <R>chat</R> <.></.> chatted <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="with"></prp_lxc1> each other in Japanese, I think, like these two girls.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Um</F> do you see any difference between high school students nowadays</A>
<B><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>and</OL> your school days?</A>
<B>Yes, I think <.></.> <F>um</F> high school students nowadays are more <.></.> <F>um</F> <aj_lxc odr="1" crr="self-centered">self-concerned</aj_lxc> <.></.> <F>ah</F> than what we were. <R>We</R> we <.></.> did what we were told or <SC>we was sup</SC> <SC>we were said</SC> what we were supposed to do <SC>but</SC> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>ah</F> without thinking <prp_lxc2 odr="1" crr="about"></prp_lxc2> its meaning. <.></.> But I think <.></.> high school students nowadays <.></.> do not do what they don't want to do, or they don't understand <SC>what</SC> why they have to do. So <F>uum</F> <R>some</R> <.></.> <SC>some part</SC> <F>um</F> <..></..> <F>um</F> <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="for"></prp_lxc1> some points, they are doing right things. But <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <.></.> sometimes <F>mm</F> you have to do something you don't want to do <nvs>laughter</nvs> in <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="your">a</pn_lxc> <n_lxc odr="2" crr="life">lifetime</n_lxc>. So <.></.> <F>er</F> <.></.> that's the <n_num odr="1" crr="difference">differences</n_num>.</B>
