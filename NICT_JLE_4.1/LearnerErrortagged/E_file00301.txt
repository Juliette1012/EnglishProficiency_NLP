<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ur</F> I have been working in one of the private schools in Tokyo for about <laughter>nearly twenty years</laughter>. And I think I like my job</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>because</OL> I like children.</B>
<A><F>Ohh</F>.</A>
<B>I really like to talk with them.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>. But, do you sometimes have difficulties?</A>
<B>Yes, <laughter>I do</laughter>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>I do have some difficulties, of course.</B>
<A><F>Urr</F>. Can you tell me one of the difficulties?</A>
<B>O K. I'm in charge of the <o_uk odr="1" crr="second year students in senior high school">senior two students</o_uk> right now. And, when they were <o_uk odr="1" crr="in the first year at junior high school">junior one students</o_uk>, one of my students <F>urr</F> <.></.> escaped from <.></.> her home <OL>in the middle of night</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>And <SC>she wa</SC> <F>urr</F> <.></.> her parents didn't know where she was. And <F>ur</F> that was <at odr="1" crr="a">the</at> big problem.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. You know what happened?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="I">We</pn_lxc> talked with her parents, and <pn_lxc odr="2" crr="I">we</pn_lxc> talked with herself, too. But <F>er</F> we couldn't find any good solution. So she <v_tns odr="1" crr="quitted">quit</v_tns> our school when she was in <.></.> <o_uk odr="2" crr="the third year at junior high school">junior three student</o_uk>.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. <F>Wow</F>. It's a serious problem.</A>
<B>Yes, it was.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. So, how do you release your stress <.></.> <OL>from your job</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Urrm</F></OL>. That's one of the biggest problems I've got <OL><laughter>at the moment</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>So I sometimes <F>urr</F> <R>go to</R> <.></.> go to see <F>ur</F> Kabuki <n_num odr="1" crr="plays">play</n_num> or <??></??> concerts</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>and <.></.> something like that.</B>
<A>Kabuki?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. What's especially <.></.> good about Kabuki?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. First of all, the <n_lxc odr="1" crr="costumes">clothes</n_lxc> of Kabuki players are really really beautiful <o_uk odr="2" crr="">to see</o_uk>. And <F>ur</F> I could be <.></.> <o_lxc odr="2" crr="steeped in"><v_fml odr="1" crr="immersed">immerse</v_fml> into</o_lxc> the Japanese old time. <.></.> <CO>So</CO>. <F>Uhm</F>. <.></.></B>
<A>So, how did you get interested in Kabuki?</A>
<B><.></.> I don't remember it <OL>well</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>. O K. All right. O K. So, on weekends, besides going to see Kabukis, what do you usually do?</A>
<B><F>Urrr</F>. What do I usually do? I don't know, <F>urm</F> <.></.> because I don't always monitor myself. <CO>So</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Sometimes, I listen to music.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>I love pop music and <at odr="1" crr="">the</at> rock music. So my favorite group is U TWO.</B>

<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Can you tell me more about U TWO?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. The lyrics of the songs are really <R>socia</R> social ones. So <.></.> that's why I love them. And <R>the</R> the melody itself <v_tns odr="1" crr="appeals">is appealing</v_tns> to me.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. What do you mean <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="by"></prp_lxc1> "appealing"?</A>

<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. So, first thing today, please look at this picture. And, please describe this picture.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. <.></.> <at odr="1" crr="A">The</at> teacher is teaching mathematics to the students. But <F>urr</F> <.></.> very few students are listening to her. And one of the students is chewing <at odr="1" crr="">a</at> gum. And <F>urr</F> <aj_lxc odr="1" crr="another">the other</aj_lxc> student is <.></.> <F>urr</F> using <SC>cell phones</SC></B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B><at odr="2" crr="a"></at> cell phone. And <F>ur</F> one of the <aj_lxc odr="1" crr="male">boy</aj_lxc> students <.></.> is listening to music and drinking <n_cnt odr="2" crr="something">somethings</n_cnt>. And two of the girls are chatting with each other, and they're not <o_lxc odr="1" crr="listening to">attending</o_lxc> <.></.> <at odr="3" crr="the"></at> <n_lxc odr="2" crr="teacher">class</n_lxc>. <F>Mm</F>. <SC>And also</SC> <.></.> but <SC>the teacher didn't</SC> <F>urm</F> the teacher doesn't seem to pay any attention to the students,</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B><.></.> I think.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>And</SC> but only one <aj_lxc odr="1" crr="male">boy</aj_lxc> student is eagerly <F>uh</F> listening to her. <.></.> He's really <.></.> a studious student,</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B><.></.> maybe.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. O K. So, what do you think of this teacher's attitude?</A>
<B><.></.> I don't think her attitude <SC>is not</SC> is good.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>Because <F>urr</F> <.></.> probably she <.></.> is a little bit nervous, and, <F>er</F> probably <o_uk odr="1" crr="she is not so experienced">her experience is not so <.></.> much</o_uk>. So she doesn't know how to control the students.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <SC>she should <.></.> ha</SC> she should <v_lxc odr="1" crr="have">get</v_lxc> more experiences.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>. So, what would you do if you are teaching to these children?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <.></.> <F>Urm</F>. Probably, <.></.> <SC>at the very first</SC> in the very first lesson, I would ask the students <F>ur</F> what kind of <.></.> <o_uk odr="1" crr="things on mathematics">mathematical points</o_uk> they're interested in. And, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>we ask</SC> <F>urm</F> <.></.> <F>ur</F> probably, I will <.></.> <v_cmp odr="2" crr="get the hints">get to <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> hints</v_cmp> to teach those kinds of students <.></.> by asking a lot of questions.</B>
</followup>

<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>urr</F> I really <SC>liked it</SC> <SC>liked them</SC> liked it, <F>ur</F> when I bought it. But, once I <.></.> came back home, and I put on the suit, I didn't like it. So I would like you to <v_cmp odr="1" crr="exchange this">exchange</v_cmp> <prp_lxc2 odr="2" crr="with"></prp_lxc2> another one.</B>
<A>That's not a good reason.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>You liked it, but, now, you don't like it?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. Yes. <R>I</R> <F>urr</F> <.></.> I didn't check any details when I bought it. <SC>So</SC> <F>urm</F> <.></.> <con_lxc odr="1" crr="and">but</con_lxc> you recommended it to me, <.></.> saying, <F>urm</F> "It's <at odr="2" crr="a"></at> really good suit.".</B>
<A>That's true.</A>
<B>So I bought it. But, <F>urm</F> when I checked it at home, <F>urm</F> <.></.> <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> size <v_tns odr="2" crr="didn't fit">doesn't fit</v_tns> me well.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>Also the zipper doesn't work well.</B>
<A><R>Wha</R> what <mo_lxc odr="1" crr="do"></mo_lxc> you mean the zipper doesn't work well?</A>
<B><F>Urrm</F>. <SC>The</SC> <.></.> <R>it doesn't wo</R> it doesn't work, <F>urr</F> 'cos <R>I</R> I couldn't <o_lxc odr="1" crr="do up">close</o_lxc> the zipper. <CO>So</CO>.</B>

<A><OL><F>Uhmm</F></OL>. But the suit was on sale, and that was our policy. All sales were final.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. I didn't know that. You didn't say that.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>. I don't know what to do. I can't decide.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. Please call <aj_lxc odr="1" crr="another">the other</aj_lxc> <.></.> clerk or the manager, please.</B>
<A>All right. <F>Urr</F>. But the manager is out of town, and he'll be back three days later.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Urm</F>. Could I make an appointment to see him?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Sure. So, maybe, you can just come back three days later,</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>and</OL> I'll talk to him.</A>
<B>O K. O K. <OL>I'll be back</OL>.</B>

<B><F>Oh</F> yeah. Not myself, but one of my <.></.> friends. But I don't remember it <OL>well</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>. Have you ever bought something in a foreign country?</A>
<B><SC>Yes, I do</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>yes, I did</SC> yes, I have.</B>

<A><F>Uhm</F>. <.></.> Any difference.</A>
<B><F>Urrr</F>. <.></.> <F>Oh-oh</F>. <.></.> I can't think <prp_lxc2 odr="1" crr="about"></prp_lxc2> <.></.> any particular differences. <F>Uhm</F>. <.></.> <F>Ahhh</F>. <F><?>Well</?></F>. The difference would be <F>er</F> <.></.> the <.></.> sales persons. The Japanese sales persons are eager to sell <.></.> anything.</B>

<B>But <F>urrr</F> <.></.> Australian sales persons <.></.> <o_uk odr="1" crr="are not like that">don't feel like that</o_uk>.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>

<A><F>Uhmm</F>.</A>
