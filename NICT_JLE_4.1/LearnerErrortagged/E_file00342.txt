<B>Completely different from. <F>Mm</F>. No. I'm sorry, but I don't remember. <F>Mm</F>. But the different thing is that the supermarket in the United Kingdom didn't offer a plastic bag.</B>
<A><F>Mhn</F> <F>ah</F>.</A>
<B>Also, customers <F>mm</F> brought their own <SC>bag</SC> <F>mm</F> shopping bag, <F>mm</F> by themselves. <OL><??></??></OL>.</B>
