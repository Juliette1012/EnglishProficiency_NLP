<A><.></.> <F>Wow</F>. Less than a month.</A>
<B>Yeah. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>How do you feel?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I have friends there. So it's not too scary or anything.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>. Do you have to use your English ability when you start working?</A>
<B><R>I thi</R> <F>uh</F> I think so. <F>Well</F> I can speak Spanish, so I <?>don't</?> think I'll be using English.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. I see. Good. All right. Now, <.></.> <R>what</R> what's your hobby?</A>
<B><F>Uum</F>. I like traveling. I've been to <F>er</F> many countries like Russia, <F>erm</F> Canada, <con_lxc odr="1" crr="">and</con_lxc> New Zealand, Taiwan, <con_lxc odr="2" crr="">and</con_lxc> <F>er</F> China, Hong Kong, <con_lxc odr="3" crr="and"></con_lxc> <??></??> <OL><??></??> like that</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Wow</F></OL>. I see. How did you like Russia?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. I didn't go there to travel. I was <F>erm</F> <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> member of <F>um</F> <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> Russia's advanced student conference.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B>So I went there to <F>um</F> participate in the conference. <F>Um</F>. I thought it <v_tns odr="1" crr="was">is</v_tns> very different from Japan, because there <v_tns odr="2" crr="was">is</v_tns> no advertisement at all.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>Like</SC> <?>let's see</?>. And <F>um</F> <SC>people there</SC> <F>uum</F> <SC>like</SC> Russian people are really different from like foreigners that I used to know. Like Americans <?><o_lxc odr="1" crr="for example">and stuff</o_lxc></?>.</B>
<A>What do you mean?</A>
<B><laughter><F>Uum</F></laughter>. I don't know. Like <R>they</R> they think <prp_lxc2 odr="1" crr="about"></prp_lxc2> <pn_lxc odr="2" crr="something">stuff</pn_lxc> in a different <?><n_num odr="3" crr="way">ways</n_num> for</?> some <n_num odr="4" crr="reasons">reason</n_num>. <o_uit odr="1">Like they think stuff really like <?>motley</?></o_uit>. They are pessimistic for some <n_num odr="1" crr="reasons">reason</n_num>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> But, I mean, my impression is that they really like studying. They are hard working people. And <F>um</F> they also had <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> really good command of English, too. Some of them study like three languages or something.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>I see. What else? When you are not traveling, what do you do?</A>
<B><laughter><F>Uum</F></laughter>. I don't know what. I <F>um</F> watch movies, <F>um</F> like mainly Hollywood movies. <F>Um</F>. For example, <R>I</R> I went to see like "A I" twice, <laughter>already</laughter>.</B>
<A><laughter>Twice</laughter>?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> Beause <F>er</F> I really like it.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>um</F> I don't know, but like watching movies in Japan is really expensive. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>I know.</A>
<B>I go there on like <n_num odr="1" crr="Wednesdays">Wednesday</n_num> like <F>er</F> <at odr="2" crr="a"></at> lady's day.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><o_uit odr="1" odr="1">Like</OL> you can sit <?>there</?> to see it like <F>er</F> <??></??> or something, yeah</o_uit>. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. Yeah. I go to <v_lxc odr="1" crr="see"></v_lxc> movies like <F>er</F> twice a month or something.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>. I see. Good. All right. Now, let's see. <.></.> <F>Oh</F> <F>oh</F> <F>er</F> are you living <SC>yourself</SC> by <OL>yourself now</OL>?</A>

<A>O K. Here is a picture for you. Have you seen this one before?</A>
<B>I think so.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> O K. Let's change that. Then, here. Please describe this picture for me.</A>
<B><F>Uum</F>. Many people are skiing. And this looks like <F>um</F> <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> mountain, and it's winter. And <F>um</F> there is a coffee shop or something in <.></.> this <n_lxc odr="1" crr="lodge">lodging</n_lxc>. And <F>um</F> <F>uum</F> the sky is clear. And <F>um</F> people <mo_lxc odr="1" crr="are"></mo_lxc> wearing like really colorful ski wears. And, <F>err</F> I don't know, there is a snowman <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="on">in</prp_lxc1> <at odr="2" crr="the">a</at> ground. And <F>um</F> <F>um</F> four kids are playing with <at odr="2" crr="">the</at> <n_lxc odr="1" crr="snow">snows</n_lxc>. And one guy is like falling down on a ski. <F>Erm</F> <F>uum</F> <F>umm</F>. And <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="it"></pn_lxc> looks like <F>um</F> <F>um</F> <at odr="2" crr="a">the</at> ski lesson is taking place, yeah. <F>Um</F>.

<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><SC><OL>Why do</OL> yo</SC> recently, lots of people enjoy snowboarding. Why do you think snowboarding is so popular amongst young generation?</A>
<B><.></.> <R>I don't</R> I don't know. It's one of <at odr="1" crr="the">those</at> trend stuff. And, <F>er</F> I guess, <F>er</F> like if you wanna <v_fml odr="1" crr="play">playing</v_fml> in the snow, like I think <F>um</F> <.></.> you had only one choice which is skiing. But like because of <F>er</F> snowboarding, like you can do different stuff from other people. So, that's why I think <at odr="1" crr="">the</at> young Japanese people think it's cool.</B>
<A>What do you mean, different stuff?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. You know, different from majority of people <o_uk odr="1" crr="who are"></o_uk> skiing.</B>

<B>So, <F>um</F> you know, young people <v_agr odr="1" crr="like">likes</v_agr> to do different stuff <laughter>from</laughter> like majorities. So I think that that's the reason.</B>

<A>What did you buy exactly?</A>
<B><F>Uum</F>. <R>I</R> I bought <at odr="1" crr="">a</at> clothes. But it didn't fit me.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B>It was too small.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <.></.> basically, <F>er</F> exchanging or refund is <F>er</F> against our policy. We normally don't do that.</A>

So I really want you to exchange it.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <F>er</F> giving <SC>your</SC> to your family is not our concern. <SC>It's just that</SC> <F>er</F> exchanging the product is not <F>er</F> acceptable. Besides, <SC>why you didn't check it</SC> why didn't you check it in a fitting room before you buy it?</A>
<B>Because I was in a hurry. And <F>um</F> <R>I</R> I <v_tns odr="1" crr="checked">check</v_tns> the size tag, and it says like medium. So I <?>thought</?> <F>er</F> <?>it</?> <R?>fit me</R?> <v_tns odr="1" crr="would fit">fit</v_tns> me, but it didn't. So <SC>I don't</SC> <SC>it's not my</SC> I don't think <laughter>it's my</laughter> fault.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. But <R>you</R> you bought it.</A>
<B>Yeah. But the size tag said it's medium. <CO>And</CO>.</B>
<A>Yeah. This size is actually medium.</A>
<B><R>I</R> <SC>I didn't</SC> I mean, I'm small. So like <R>I</R> I normally buy like one or two, size. So I thought the medium would be a little bigger or something. But it didn't fit me. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
