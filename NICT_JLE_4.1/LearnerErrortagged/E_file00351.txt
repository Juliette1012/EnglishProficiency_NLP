<A>O K. Good morning.</A>
<B>Good morning.</B>
<A>My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have your name, please?</A>
<B>O K. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>Ms <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, how are you today?</A>
<B>I'm fine, thank you. And you?</B>
<A>Yeah. Fine, thank you. <F>Er</F>. Where do you come from?</A>
<B>I come from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> Prefecture.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. Is that your hometown?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. No. Actually, I was born in <F>erm</F> Osaka. But, after I got married, I moved to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <.></.> <F>Er</F>. Do you like <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city?</A>
<B>Yes. I like it <OL>very much</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>. Can you tell me about <.></.> <SC>your</SC> <F>er</F> <.></.> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city for me?</A>
<B><H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city? <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> <F>Erm</F>. It <.></.> has a very nice <o_lxc odr="1" crr="cultural background">background <SC>as <F>ur</F> <F>erm</F> in culture</SC></B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F></A>
<B><SC>and</SC> probably <F>urm</F> in culture</o_lxc>. And they have a good school, <con_lxc odr="1" crr="and"></con_lxc> <?>prestigious</?> universities. And also, elementary schools <?>have always been <aj_lxc odr="1" crr="good">nice</aj_lxc></?>. And people are very friendly. <R>And</R> <F>erm</F> <.></.> and they have <at odr="1" crr="">a</at> nice <F>ur</F> shopping centers.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mm-hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> we can just go around and have fun. So it's a very nice city.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. How do you compare <F>er</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city and your hometown?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. <.></.> You know, <R>my home</R> <F>uh</F> my hometown in Osaka, <.></.> it's <.></.> kind of difficult to say, but <F>er</F> <F>erm</F> <.></.> the level of <.></.> <F>er</F> living is <.></.> rather low compared to that of <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city. And also, <R>the</R> <SC>they</SC> <.></.> <F>erm</F> that city doesn't have a nice <.></.> atmosphere in schools and in <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> town, <av_lxc odr="2" crr="either">too</av_lxc>. So I prefer <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city than my <.></.> hometown.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I see. <F>Er</F>. <R>S</R> so you live there with your family?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Can you tell me about your family, please?</A>
<B>Family? <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> In my family, I have <SC>pare</SC> my parents and my <F>ur</F> younger sister and me. So that's four of us. And <F>er</F> my <.></.> father works for <at odr="1" crr="a">the</at> trading company, but he's retired now. And my <.></.> <F>er</F> mother has been a <R>hou</R> housewife <.></.> since she got married. And my sister, <F>urm</F> she is a sculptor. She graduated from <SC>the</SC> <F>ur</F> one of the <.></.> <F>er</F> art <n_num odr="1" crr="colleges">college</n_num> in Kyoto. And she <v_tns odr="1" crr="majored">'s majored</v_tns> in <F>er</F> <SC>sculp</SC> <R>scu</R> <F>er</F> sculpture. But she's now being very busy about raising her child. So <SC>she really</SC> she's now <R>st</R> stopped doing her sculpture work. But she'll be <R>re</R> resuming sometime in the future, I <OL>think</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>. I see. O K. Do you have any hobbies?</A>
<B><.></.> <laughter>Hobbies</laughter>? <F>Hmm</F>. <.></.> <F>Um</F>. I have been attending <at odr="1" crr="a">the</at> translation class at <F>er</F> one of the English schools in Osaka for half a year. So I have been very busy doing <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="my"></pn_lxc> homework for that school. So I really don't have much <.></.> time for <F>urm</F> <v_lxc odr="1" crr="having">doing</v_lxc> some <n_num odr="2" crr="hobbies">hobby</n_num>. <SC>But</SC> so, <.></.> right now, <.></.> <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> studying the translation work is <.></.> kind of <.></.> <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> hobby to me.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. I see. So, why are you interested in <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> translation class?</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. I majored in English language at my college. But, at that time, I didn't like <F>erm</F> doing the translation work. I was much more interested in doing <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> some kind of research for the linguistics or something. <SC>But, <F>er</F> after</SC> and, after I got married, I had a chance to <F>erm</F> live in the States for five years. <R>And</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> and, I don't know, <F>er</F> I just <.></.> began to think, maybe, <F>er</F> the translation <SC>will be <.></.> my</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> I don't know, <SC>my</SC> <v_tns odr="1" crr="would be">will be</v_tns> very good for me. Because, <F>erm</F> now, I have a child, so <R>I</R> <SC>I</SC> my child wants me to stay home and do something with her. So, if I do the translation as my work, I can <F>erm</F> stay at home and do the work <.></.> as well. So that's why I decided to study <.></.> <R>tra</R> translation.</B>

<stage2>
<task>
<A><F>Mm</F>. O K. I see. Thank you very much. <.></.> I think that is good choice.</A>

<B>O K. <.></.> <F>Erm</F>. This is a <.></.> scene in <SC>the</SC> one of the <.></.> <F>erm</F> towns. And there is a quite big house. And also, I see a lot of people, especially, children playing around the house and <F>er</F> <.></.> two women <.></.> having a chat on the road. And I see <F>er</F> one man <.></.> <SC>doing</SC> <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> running. <F>Em</F>. And <F>er</F> I see a lot of trees in the <F>ur</F> backyard of the house. And <F>er</F> <SC>the children are playing with balls</SC> the boys are playing <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="with"></prp_lxc1> balls.

And there is a <.></.> <F>um</F> cat sleeping on the roof <.></.> of that car. And <F>er</F> one of the ladies chatting, she has a dog with her. And I suppose she is <.></.> <F>erm</F> taking this dog for a walk, I think.</B>

<A>O K. Thank you. You said <F>er</F> you <v_tns odr="1" crr="lived">live</v_tns> in the States.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>All right. <F>Er</F>. What part of the States?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. First, I lived in <at odr="1" crr="">the</at> <F>er</F> Chicago area <.></.> <R>for</R> <.></.> for <SC>two years</SC> <F>m</F> two and a half years and then, moved to <F>er</F> <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> area <.></.> and lived there for another two and a half years.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I see. So, <F>er</F> <.></.> can you describe the house in <.></.> Chicago?</A>
<B>Chicago? <F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A>In detail. <F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><SC?>Live</SC?> <F>er</F></OL> either one is O K.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Erm</F>. <SC>The</SC> <.></.> in Chicago, we lived in <at odr="1" crr="">the</at> one of the town house.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>And we had <F>erm</F> a two stories <F>erm</F> <.></.> <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="about"></prp_lxc1> <at odr="2" crr="a"></at> house. <.></.> <F>Oh</F>. <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="We">It</pn_lxc> <v_lxc odr="2" crr="had" ch="1">'s</v_lxc> <F>mm</F> three bedrooms. <.></.> And, while I was there, I had a baby. So, <F>erm</F> when we went to the States, we didn't have a child. So we used the whole house for <SC>us</SC> <R>the two of</R> the two of us. But, after <F>uh</F> <SC>we ha</SC> <F>uh</F> I had a baby, we <v_tns odr="1" crr="had">have</v_tns> to have one room for her. And <F>er</F> we put <at odr="1" crr="a">some</at> baby bed in one of the bedrooms. And <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>hmm</F> it changed a lot after we had a baby. <.></.> <o_uit odr="1">And, <F>erm</F> after we moved to <F>erm</F> San Francisco area, we lived in <F>aw</F> one of the houses</o_uit>. And <F>er</F> it was <F>er</F> quite a big house. And quite a big <F>er</F> backyard. So my <.></.> girl <F>erm</F> was playing a lot in <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> backyard <F>urm</F> riding a tricycle and moved to the bicycle afterwards.</B>

<A>You ready?</A>
<B><.></.> O K.</B>
<A>O K. Hello?</A>
<B>Hello? <F>Erm</F>. This is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. And I'm very sorry that I couldn't <SC>make to</SC> <F>erm</F> go to your party <.></.> tonight. <F>Erm</F>. I really wanted to go, but my girl <F>erm</F> <SC>has</SC> <mo_lxc odr="1" crr="is"></mo_lxc> having a cold. And, tonight, <SC>she had</SC> all of a sudden, she <v_lxc odr="1" crr="got">had</v_lxc> a high temperature. So I really couldn't <F>er</F> leave her alone in the house. So that's why I couldn't make it to your party. And <F>er</F> I really hope to come to your party <F>um</F> next time you <v_tns odr="1" crr="have">had</v_tns> <at odr="2" crr="a">this</at> chance. So, please call me whenever you have <at odr="1" crr="a">the</at> party again.</B>
<A>O K. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, <F>er</F> I understand. But everybody was waiting for you.</A>
<B>O K. I'm really sorry. I was really looking forward to the party myself, too. So it was a great <F>erm</F> <R>dis</R> disappointment to me,</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>also.</B>
<A>I thought you asked some babysitter.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. Yes. I thought of that, <F>er</F> <.></.> too. But I really didn't want to leave my child having a <n_lxc odr="1" crr="fever">temperature</n_lxc>. So, please <F>erm</F> understand it. Forgive me not able to come to your party.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. O K, O K. I see. So, maybe, we are going to have another party <F>er</F> next week.</A>
<B>O K. So I hope to come to your party next time.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. Thank you very much for calling.</A>
<B>You're welcome. And thank you.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. Thank you. This is the end of role play. <F>Er</F>. when you were in the States, <F>er</F> did you attend a lot of parties?</A>
<B>No, not really. <F>Erm</F>. Beause my child was <F>er</F> quite small, and, as I said in our conversation, I didn't want to leave her, and I didn't want <SC>to <F>erm</F> <F>er</F> <R>try the</R> <.></.> <F>er</F> try the</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> someone <av_lxc odr="1" crr="else"></av_lxc> to keep my child.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><con_lxc odr="1" crr="">But</con_lxc> I didn't want to <.></.> try that. So I didn't have any chances to <?>attend parties</?>.</B>
<A><F>Er</F>. Did you see any differences <F>er</F> between the ways of raising <SC>child</SC> children?</A>
<B><F>Emm</F>. <.></.> <F>Erm</F>. <SC>while I was in the States, I</SC> <.></.> <F>mm</F> <F>um</F> before I went to the States, I thought <F>er</F> American <n_num odr="1" crr="husbands">husband</n_num> will be much more <F>erm</F> <.></.> helpful than <at odr="3" crr="">the</at> Japanese <n_num odr="2" crr="husbands">husband</n_num>. But <F>er</F> I was talking to one of <at odr="1" crr="">the</at> American mothers, and <SC>said</SC> she said that <F>er</F> her husband was not really helpful either. <laughter>So I was really</laughter> <F>erm</F> <.></.> surprised to hear that. And <F>er</F> it was <F>erm</F> <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> hubbub to raise a child, and <SC>my</SC> <F>uh</F> her husband was quite busy with work. So <.></.> I thought that some of the American <F>erm</F> <.></.> men are like Japanese men, I think.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <.></.> I see. <.></.> O K. Maybe, you have a good husband. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><laughter><F>Oh</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I <?>agree though</?></laughter></OL>.</B>

<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures and thinking.</ctxt>
<A>O K?</A>
<B><.></.> O K. <.></.> <F>Er</F>. One day last week, <F>uh</F> I was driving. And <F>er</F> I saw a man on a scooter coming <F>er</F> toward me. And <F>er</F> he was talking with somebody on the cell phone. <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> And <F>er</F> <.></.> we got bumped.

And, <F>er</F> <.></.> at the time the police was there, I explained to <.></.> the policeman that the <.></.> man was riding on the scooter at the same time he was <F>er</F> talking to somebody with the cell phone. And <F>er</F> <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> policeman understood. <.></.> <SC>And</SC> <.></.> so, <R>the</R> <.></.> <SC>the man's scooter</SC> <.></.> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <.></.> at the end, <F>er</F> we called a truck to <F>er</F> <.></.> take his scooter away. <.></.> And the policeman told us that <F>er</F> <.></.> the man on the scooter was responsible for the accident. Because he was not really <F>erm</F> <.></.> cautious about riding scooter.</B>

<B><F>Erm</F>. <.></.> I usually drive <.></.> <F>er</F> only <.></.> around my house, because I'm not really confident <SC>on my</SC> <F>uh</F> about my driving technique. <F>Erm</F>. But, sometimes, <F>erm</F> my husband <F>uh</F> drives to Osaka. And, while I <v_tns odr="1" crr="am sitting">was sitting</v_tns> next to him, I really get scared with the driving manner of the Osaka people.
