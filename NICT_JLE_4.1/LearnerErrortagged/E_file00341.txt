<B>Sure, you can.</B>
<A>Nice to meet you, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
<B>Nice to meet you, too.</B>
<A>How are you today?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. I'm fine.</B>
<A>And, where do you live?</A>
<B>I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city.</B>
<A><H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city? <F>Oh</F>. With your family?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. No. <SC>Acu</SC> <R>I</R> I live alone.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. You live alone? O K. How do you enjoy <o_lxc odr="1" crr="living alone">living you alone</o_lxc>? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter><F>Well</F></laughter> <F>ah</F>. I'd say I enjoy the freedom.</B>
<A>Freedom?</A>
<B><R>Freedom of</R> freedom of all for myself.</B>
<A><F>Um-hm</F>. For examples?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. <CO><SC>For example, I don't have to</SC> for example, in my apartment, I don't really have to care about</CO>. <F>Um</F>. <.></.> Let me put it this way. <F>An</F>. Since no one is around in my apartment, so <F>an</F> I can do whatever I want at any time I want. So that's one of the great advantages that I have <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="by"></prp_lxc1> living alone.</B>
<A>But, when you feel alone or sad, what do you do?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F>. I turn on T V, or <R>I</R> I sometimes talk to the wall.</B>
<A>Wall? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter>I am occasionally talk to</laughter> myself.</B>
<A><F>Um-hm</F>.</A>
<B>And I make phone calls to my friends.</B>
<A><F>Um-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. I watch movies, so <F>ah</F> I go outside and do something else.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Really? So, do you use a mobile phone?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F>. I don't have a mobile phone.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Really? It's O K for you?</A>
<B>It's O K for me. Yes.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Really? O K. So, <SC>do you</SC> what do you do?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. I'm actually <F>ah</F> studying at a language school.</B>
<A><F>Um-hm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> I <o_lxc odr="1" crr="would like to">like to</o_lxc> be, if possible, <at odr="2" crr="a"></at> professinonal English-Japanese or Japanese-English translator or interpreter. So I'm not working at this moment. But <F>um</F> I'd like to focus on my studying instead of working at this moment.</B>
<A>So, why did you get interested in <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> interpreter or translator?</A>
<B><F>Ahh</F>. I think <F>am</F> it's like a long <n_lxc odr="1" crr="story">history</n_lxc>. First, I think when I was a kid like probably ten or eleven years old, I just got interested in English and thought it was kind of cool <laughter>to speak English</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Um-hm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>And</SC> so I think that's the beginning, and then, <F>am</F> <R>I started to</R> <F>ah</F> I started to get more interested in learning English as I <F>ah</F> grew older. And, <F>er</F> in college, I started thinking about my future. And I think that's the time when I thought that <SC>I wanted</SC> I wanna be an interpreter.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Really? <F>Wow</F>. O K. Good luck. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><OL>Thank you so much</OL>.</B>

<stage2>
<task>
<A>First of all, I'll show a picture. Here you are. O K. And, could you describe this picture in detail?</A>
<B>All right. <F>Ahh</F>. I see three kids playing around <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> house, one girl is jumping a rope, and two boys are playing with a ball. To me, it seems that they are playing volleyball. <F>Um</F>. <SC>See</SC> and one man in <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> blue sweatshirt and pants are jogging, he <mo_lxc odr="2" crr="is"></mo_lxc> also sweating. And there is a car in front of the house. And there is a <SC>cat</SC> <F>ah</F> <SC>brown cat</SC> light brown cat <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="on">under</prp_lxc1> <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> roof of the car. <F>Ah</F>. It's a white or silver car. And, by the car, there are two women talking or chatting. <F>Ah</F>. One of them is wearing a red shirt and a gray skirt, and the other woman is in <at odr="2" crr="a" ch="1"></at> red <n_num odr="1" crr="suit">suits</n_num>. She also <F>ah</F> <v_lxc odr="1" crr="wears">has</v_lxc> a pink shirt, and she has a dog <F>am</F> that has brown and white colors. And, across from the house, I see a man reading <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> newspaper. He's sitting on a <n_lxc odr="1" crr="bench">couch</n_lxc>. And <SC>this</SC> there are two trees by this man. <SC>It seems like sunny day</SC> it's a sunny day.</B>
<A>O K. <?><o_uit odr="1">It's ready</o_uit></?>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Thank you very much.</A>
<B>You are welcome.</B>
<A>O K. So, where is your hometown?</A>
<B>My hometown is in Okayama prefecture.</B>
<A>Okayama prefecture? Do you miss it? Your hometown?</A>
<B><F>Umm</F>. No, <laughter>not really</laughter>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Could you compare your hometown with <F>ah</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city where you live?</A>
<B>Excuse me?</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. Could you compare</A>
<B><F>Um-hm</F>.</B>
<A>Okayama city <OL>with</OL></A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><H pn="others1">XXX03</H> <OL>city</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>All right</OL>. <F>Ahh</F>. My hometown is <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> very tiny town with around four thousand people. And <F>ah</F> the town is surrounded by mountains. <F>Ah</F>. But <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city is <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> big city to me. I think <o_uk odr="1" crr="there are">it has</o_uk> probably four hundred thousand people living in the city. And all I see is just houses and houses and buildings. So that's the big difference, the countryside and <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> city.</B>
<A>Why did you move to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. When I enrolled <prp_lxc2 odr="1" crr="in"></prp_lxc2> college.</B>
<A><F>Um-hm</F>. Is it <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> good city for you?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> <F>well</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> In terms of the envirnoment, I'm not very much in favor of, especially, the air.</B>
<A>The air?</A>
<B>The air. Because <F>ah</F> it seems to be polluted a little bit. The skies are usually gray. I don't see the clear blue sky many times. Whereas, back in my hometown, <F>ah</F> the water doesn't smell, and the air doesn't smell. <SC>It's just</SC> <F>ah</F> it was just <F>ah</F> fresh and nice. <o_uit odr="1">And I guess that's <laughter>about it</o_uit></laughter>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Your hometown must be a very good place.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. To live, <F>um-hm</F> maybe, and, for my body, too.</B>
