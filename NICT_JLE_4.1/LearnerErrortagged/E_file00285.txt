<B>And he works for <F>em</F> <at odr="1" crr="an"></at> American company, and he <SC>is</SC> <?>uses</?> English for his job. And, <F>eh</F> what else? My husband and I <.></.> like to <o_lxc odr="1" crr="go snowboading">snowboard</o_lxc>. So, every weekend, we go to <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> mountainside.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B>Every weekend in winter.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>Yeah. What else <R>my</R> <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="about"></prp_lxc1> my husband? <F>Mm</F>. He is <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> kind of <laughter>eccentric person</laughter>. <F>Uhm</F>. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>In <at odr="1" crr="">a</at> what way</OL>? Why do you think so?</A>
<B>He is funny, and <F>eh</F> <.></.> <R>he</R> he is unusual as a Japanese man. <F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A><OL>For example</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><R>I mean that</R> I mean that</OL> he doesn't seem to think that <F>eh</F> women should do this do that, and men should do this do that, <R>other</R> <con_lxc odr="1" crr="as"></con_lxc> other Japanese men tend to think.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>Then, how do you share housework with him?</A>
<B><F>Eh</F>. Now, I'm <SC>a</SC> just a housewife. So, can I say <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> housewife?</B>
<A><OL>Sure</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>House</R></OL> housewife, yes. So, mainly, I do all the stuff, you know, <n_lxc odr="1" crr="housework">house</n_lxc>, and he works. But, later, <F>umm</F> probably, I hope I can find a kind of job, and then, we can share <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> housework.</B>
<A>I see. Then, what kind of job are you expecting?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. I used to teach at an elementary school, so the only thing I can do is <av_lxc odr="1" crr="">just</av_lxc> teaching. So, yeah, I hope that I can get a teaching job <.></.> <OL>like before</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. <F>Uh-huh</F>. Using English?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. My major is actually Japanese. <CO>So</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Uhm</F>.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>Maybe, I can teach anything <F>uhm</F> <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="at"></prp_lxc1> <at odr="2" crr="an"></at> elementary school level.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. Why did you quit teaching?</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F>. Because <F>ah</F> I wanted to go to the States with my husband. And, in order to get the <R>vis</R> <SC>visa</SC> yeah, visa, <F>ah</F> we had to marry. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And <SC>it</SC> it's <??></??> <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> funny story <SC>but</SC> so that <v_lxc odr="2" crr="is"></v_lxc> why I quit my job and got married and went to the States for a while, then came back.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. I see. So, of course, you saw American children there.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. So, how do you compare Japanese children with <OL><??></??> <n_lxc odr="1" crr="children"></n_lxc> in America</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Em</F> <?>I think</?>, basically, it <v_lxc odr="1" crr="">'s</v_lxc> depends</OL> on the area. <F>Er</F>. And, <F>eh</F> <SC>even though</SC> even before I went to the States, I thought that <at odr="1" crr="">a</at> Japanese media only <F>eh</F> gave us <at odr="2" crr="">a</at> bad news mainly <prp_lxc1 odr="3" crr="of">in</prp_lxc1> the United States. So <SC>I thought that's</SC> <F>ah</F> in my opinion, <SC>i</SC> ordinary people are not so different from Japanese ordinary people. And then, I went to the States, and, there, <R>it's</R> <F>ah</F> it's called up-state New York, so <SC>even it</SC> even it's in <?>di</?> New York <n_num odr="1" crr="State">States</n_num>, <pn_lxc odr="2" crr="it">that</pn_lxc> 's <at odr="3" crr="a"></at> very rural area and <at odr="4" crr="a"></at> small city <v_lxc odr="5" crr="was"></v_lxc> there. So I went to <F>ah</F> elementary <n_num odr="1" crr="schools">school</n_num> <prp_lxc1 odr="2" crr="for"></prp_lxc1> several times, then, I found that the kids in those schools are much much better, behave <aj_us odr="3" crr="better">good</aj_us> than Japanese <OL>ordinary <??></??> <n_lxc odr="4" crr="kids"></n_lxc>, yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> really</OL>? <F>Ah</F> <F>wow</F>. That's amazing.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>All right. Thank you very much.</A>
<B><OL>You're welcome</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. All right. So, now, O K, please look at this picture. This must be good for you. <OL>O K, please</OL> describe the picture.</A>
<B><OL><laughter><F>Uhm</F></laughter> yeah</OL>. <F>Ahm</F>. It's a scene on the <R>ski</R> <SC>ski area</SC> <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> ski resort, I think. And I see, <SC>it's</SC> probably, it's not in Japan, it's somewhere in Europe, and there are <?>several</?> people <v_fml odr="1" crr="enjoying">enjoy</v_fml> skiing. <R>And</R> and there's one snowboarder, because I'm a snowboarder. <CO>So</CO>. And, <F>am</F> this part, <F>ah</F> there're several children playing <F>ah</F> <av_lxc odr="1" crr="">there</av_lxc>, I don't know <itr_lxc odr="2" crr="how">what</itr_lxc> it's called, but they're throwing snowballs and fighting each other <F>eh</F> just for fun. And then, <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="on"></prp_lxc1> the <SC>other side</SC> upper left side of this picture, <F>err</F> <at odr="2" crr="a">one</at> couple is <R>si</R> sitting. And, what else? <.></.> Probably he or she, I don't know, but <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> <v_agr odr="1" crr="teaches">teach</v_agr> her how to ski. <.></.> There <v_agr odr="1" crr="is">are</v_agr> another couple. Probably, there <v_lxc odr="1" crr="is"></v_lxc> another couple, and she is much better than him. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. All right, but you said this is not <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="in"></prp_lxc1> Japan, why did you think so?</A>
<B><F>Em</F>. <?>Just the</?> atmosphere. <F>Hum</F>. <..></..> Yeah. <R>Ju</R> just <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="by">for</prp_lxc1> <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> <OL>atmosphere. <nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>O K, so, <R>wha</R></OL> what is the atmosphere <OL>in <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> Japanese ski resort like</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Atmosphere</OL>? <F>Ah</F> <F>ah</F> <F>uhm</F>. <av_lxc odr="1" crr="First">At first</av_lxc>, the ski lift <SC>is not</SC> doesn't seem to be very new <pn_lxc odr="2" crr="">one</pn_lxc>, so I think <pn_lxc odr="3" crr="it">that</pn_lxc> 's <o_odr odr="4" crr="probably in">in probably</o_odr> Europe, <SC>there still</SC> <F>ah</F> they <av_pst odr="5" crr="still have">have still</av_pst> the old <F>ah</F> ski lift. So, probably, that's why I think it's in Europe.</B>
<A>I see. Then, so, you must be a good snowboarder.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> I don't know.</B>
<A><laughter>O K</laughter>. So, could you give us <at odr="1" crr="the">some</at> beginners</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A><F>em</F> some advice?</A>
<B>Advice? <OL><F>Ah</F> for <SC>snowboarding</SC> <R>snow</R> snowboarding</OL>?</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F> <n_num odr="1" crr="snowboarders">snowboarder</n_num>, yeah</OL>.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Em</F>. The one big difference between <F>ah</F> skiing and snowboarding is that, <F>ah</F> <SC>the snowboa</SC> <SC>for snowboarder</SC> for a snowboarder, <F>ah</F> <.></.> both legs <SC>are</SC> <.></.> must be <v_fml odr="1" crr="stuck">stick</v_fml> to <at odr="2" crr="the">a</at> board. So it's very dangerous once you lose the balance. So, <SC>it's very</SC> be careful <o_uk odr="2" crr="when you fall down">about <at odr="1" crr="">the</at> falling down</o_uk>. So <SC>first, you ha</SC> the first thing you have to learn is that how to fall down.</B>

<B>My car? My car is Honda. <F>Ah</F>. The reason I bought the car Honda is that my husband and I like Honda.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hum</F>. The reason why we like Honda is because Honda is <at odr="1" crr="the">a</at> first car company in Japan to participate in <F>ah</F> the car race <F>ah</F> <R>so</R> so called F One, Formula One car race.

<A><OL>Do you have a sport car</OL>?</A>

<A>I see.</A>
<B>including two boards.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F> I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F> <F>hum</F></OL>. And, for me, car is just a car, just <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> drive and carry us <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="to"></prp_lxc1> somewhere else, but, for my husband, or I assume that <prp_lxc1 odr="2" crr="for"></prp_lxc1> most of men, car is something like a precious <n_lxc odr="3" crr="thing"></n_lxc> for them, <at odr="4" crr="a"></at> kind of like <at odr="5" crr="an">a</at> accessory, or <.></.> <F>um</F> I don't know. <SC>But</SC> <F>eh</F> so the <n_lxc odr="1" crr="feeling">attitude</n_lxc> <SC>for</SC> <prp_lxc1 odr="2" crr="for">toward</prp_lxc1> <at odr="3" crr="the"></at> car is very different from the woman's <n_lxc odr="4" crr="feeling">attitude</n_lxc>.</B>
