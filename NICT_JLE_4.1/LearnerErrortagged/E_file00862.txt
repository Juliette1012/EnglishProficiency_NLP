<A>O K. <F>Um</F>. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have your name, please?</A>
<B>My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Nice to meet you.</A>
<B>Nice to meet you, too.</B>
<A>How are you this morning?</A>
<B>Yeah, a little bit <laughter>nervous</laughter> this morning, but I'm fine today.</B>
<A>O K, good. <F>Well</F> what do you usually do <o_lxc odr="1" crr="in the morning">in a morning</o_lxc> at the office?</A>
<B>At the office? So my case is very different from others'. I'm working <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="at">with</prp_lxc1> <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> home office in Osaka.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hum</F>.</A>
<B>So, <o_lxc odr="1" crr="in the morning">the morning</o_lxc> <.></.> <F>mm</F> while <v_lxc odr="2" crr="having">taking</v_lxc> <at odr="3" crr="">a</at> breakfast, I <v_lxc odr="4" crr="check">see</v_lxc> <at odr="6" crr="">the</at> <n_num odr="5" crr="E-mails">E-mail</n_num> that <F>ah</F> come to me.</B>
<A><F>Ah-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So <SC>I was</SC> I <v_asp odr="1" crr="do">'m doing</v_asp> <aj_lxc odr="2" crr="those">the</aj_lxc> two things at the same time in the morning. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>So you are visiting from Osaka.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. O K. So, can you tell me the differences between <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> Osaka office and this office in Tokyo?</A>
<B>So, in Osaka, we don't have <at odr="1" crr="an">a</at> office. I'm working at my own <R>ho</R> home office, so two guys are working in Osaka. <o_uit odr="1"><?>For some there</?> working in a home office</o_uit>.</B>
<A><F>Ah-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Yes. So the people <v_lxc odr="1" crr="are"></v_lxc> quite different. So this is <SC>the</SC> <av_pst odr="1" crr="the only">only the</av_pst> office. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So I can't compare anyway.</B>
<A>I see. O K. So, <F>ah</F> what is good about working at home?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> so I can manage my time. So <SC>we don't</SC> <SC>I don't</SC> <.></.> <SC>I can't</SC> <SC>I do not use</SC> I do need to use my time <R>for</R> <.></.> for going to the office. <SC>We can save the time</SC> I can save the time.</B>
<A><CO>Are <OL>there</OL></CO>?</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>Usually, <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="it"></pn_lxc> <v_tns odr="2" crr="takes">took</v_tns> one hour from my <n_lxc odr="3" crr="house">home</n_lxc> to the Osaka office, but I can save the time for <OL>myself</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>Sou</R></OL> sounds great.</A>
<B>Yes. Yeah,</B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>in that</OL> respect, yes, good. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>But, are there any <SC>flaws</SC> <F>ah</F> bad things about working at home?</A>
<B>Yeah. The other thing is that <F>ah</F> it's very difficult to control. <.></.> So, for example, <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="during"></prp_lxc1> <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> summer vacation, <.></.> <con_lxc odr="3" crr="">so</con_lxc> children are around</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>my office <v_cmp odr="4" crr="asking me">asking</v_cmp> something while I'm working. So I'd like to concentrate on <n_lxc odr="1" crr="work">business</n_lxc>, but <F>ah</F> <av_lxc odr="2" crr="sometimes">sometime</av_lxc> they <v_cmp odr="3" crr="disturb me">disturb</v_cmp>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> I see.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>So you have children.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>Would you tell me about them?</A>
<B>Yes, I have <SC>two <.></.> kids</SC> two boys. <F>Ah</F> one is the <.></.> first year of <at odr="1" crr="">the</at> high school and the other is the second year of <at odr="2" crr="">the</at> junior high.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hum</F>.</A>
<B>They both <F>er</F> play tennis. They are very good <prp_cmp odr="1" crr="at it">at</prp_cmp>, so I'm very proud of them.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><.></.> O K. So, how do you enjoy <n_num odr="1" crr="weekends">weekend</n_num> with them?</A>
