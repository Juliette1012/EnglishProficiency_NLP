<A>What kind of music?</A>
<B>I am <.></.> crazy about <SC>seventy's</SC> <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> sixty's and <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> seventy's black music.</B>

<A>But that's different from your friends, I guess.</A>
<B><.></.></B>
<A>Your friends <mo_lxc odr="1" crr="must"></mo_lxc> listen to more contemporary <OL>music</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A>What do they think about <at odr="1" crr="the">your</at> <.></.> old style rock-n-roll?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> I think <F>urr</F> <.></.> rock music <SC>is</SC> <F>urr</F> was at it's <n_lxc odr="1" crr="peak">best</n_lxc> in <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> sixties and seventies.

<A>Right.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><R>Wha</R> what <mo_lxc odr="1" crr="do"></mo_lxc> your friends think about that?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. <.></.> Perhaps, they think of me as <at odr="2" crr="an"></at> <aj_lxc odr="1" crr="outdated">old fashion</aj_lxc> and a kind of <R>weird</R> weird person. <F>Er</F>. Yes.</B>
<A>And, how do you respond to that?</A>
<B><F>Uhmm</F>. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> is different from <.></.> others, so <R>that's</R> that's all.</B>
<A>O K. You mentioned your mother. Do you live with your family?</A>
<B>Yes, I live with <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="my">your</pn_lxc> family.</B>

<A>O K. O K. A lot of students live on their own near college. Why didn't you decide to live on your own?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. My parents are very strict. So <SC>that</SC> <SC>I can't</SC> I couldn't <SC>live myself</SC> live <SC>my</SC> by myself.</B>
<A>What did you feel about that?</A>
<B>I feel sorry for that. But, <F>uhm</F> as for me, I <.></.> couldn't and can't afford to live by myself. So <.></.> <SC>I</SC> all I can do is <v_fin odr="1" crr="to depend">depend</v_fin> on <.></.> them, <SC>financially or</SC> yeah, financially. <F>Uhmm</F>.</B>
<A><OL><CO>What</CO></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>Psycholo</R></OL> <.></.> <av_lxc odr="1" crr="mentally">psychologically</av_lxc>, also.</B>
<A>Sure. But they allow you to listen to rock music, so they are not so strict.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> Yes. <F>Uhmm</F>. <.></.> <F>Uhm</F>. <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="My"></pn_lxc> <cap odr="2" crr="parents" ch="1">Parents</cap> have <.></.> some rules <F>er</F> <.></.> as long as <R>I can</R> <.></.> I can do that.

<A><F>Uhm</F>. <.></.> <SC>What's</SC> you said, "without purpose", but everything has a purpose. How do you feel when you walk?</A>

<A>Can you tell me a bit more about what you did together?</A>
