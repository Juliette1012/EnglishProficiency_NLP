<A>O K. <F>Er</F> let's begin. For the record, may I have your name, please?</A>
<B>My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>? O K. <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>, where are you from?</A>
<B><F>Em</F> I'm from <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>, Japan. I grow up in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>, and I'm still here in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. Have you ever lived outside <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Yeah, actually I'm a <F>em</F> college student. And I studied abroad when I was a sophomore <n_lxc odr="1" crr="">year</n_lxc>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Where did you go?</A>
<B><H pn="others2">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="others2">XXX03</H>.</A>
<B><F>Mhm-hum</F>. It was a great city</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Really</OL>. I mean, very nice and very, I think, neat.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see. So, you stayed <av_lxc odr="1" crr="there"></av_lxc> for one year.</A>
<B>One and a half.</B>
<A>One and a half? <F>Ah</F>. <F>Mm</F>. What did you enjoy most?</A>
<B><F>Em</F>. Communicating with people <av_lxc odr="1" crr="mainly">mostly</av_lxc> <rel_lxc odr="2" crr="whom">where</rel_lxc> I studied English, <prp_lxc1 odr="3" crr="with"></prp_lxc1> and I improved my English <n_num odr="4" crr="skills">skill</n_num>, I guess, there.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-hum</F>. O K. Please tell me a little about your hobbies.</A>
<B>Hobbies? <F>Em</F>. I like to <F>em</F> watch <F>ah</F> T V and movies. And I enjoy driving and scuba diving.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>For</OL> scuba diving, where do you go?</A>
<B><F>Em</F>. Mostly, when I was staying in <H pn="others2">XXX03</H>, we went to the Caribbean Sea or <at odr="1" crr="">the</at> Florida. And, <F>mm</F> unfortunately, I don't have many chances to <F>em</F> <v_cmp odr="1" crr="go diving">go to diving</v_cmp> while I'm staying here in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>. But I'm planning to.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. O K.</A>
<B><F>Mhm-hum</F>.</B>
<A>What's the attraction of scuba diving?</A>
<B>Attraction? <F>Em</F>. Very different from this world. <F>Mm</F>. Actually, we have to put a lot of <n_cnt odr="1" crr="equipment">equipments</n_cnt> on our body, and it's heavy. But, <F>em</F> <R>if you go inside</R> if you go inside the sea, you can see many different things and the difference makes <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="you">me</pn_lxc> <F>mm</F> most interested in diving, I think.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. O K. Right. Thank you.</A>
<B><F>Mhm-hum</F>.</B>

<A>O K. Let me show you <at odr="1" crr="the">a</at> first picture <OL>today</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A>Please describe this picture for me.</A>
<B><SC>It looks like a part</SC> it looks like a restaurant. And there are three couples enjoying <at odr="1" crr="">the</at> dinner. And one couple is supposed to have <at odr="1" crr="">a</at> dinner now, I guess. And a man is having a wine. And the <F>em</F> <n_lxc odr="1" crr="waiter">servant</n_lxc> is coming up to the couple and trying to show and <v_lxc odr="2" crr="tell">describe</v_lxc> the <n_num odr="3" crr="name">names</n_num> of the wine and <F>er</F> where it comes from or something like that. And the couple is listening to the <n_lxc odr="1" crr="waiter">servant</n_lxc>. And they look <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="">like</prp_lxc1> very happy and enjoying the dinner, and also, <R>behind the</R> behind the tables, there is a woman playing the piano. The time is now seven o'clock. And it looks like a great dinner.</B>
<A>O K. Good.</A>
<B><OL>Is that</OL> enough?</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>. Thank you.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Em</F>. Do you like going to this kind of restaurant?</A>
<B>Excuse me? Do I like to go?</B>
<A>Go to this kind of restaurant?</A>
<B>Not really. This is <F>em</F> a little bit too <F>em</F> formal for me.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="For">To</prp_lxc1> me, it's better to walk freely and talk to a lot of people.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Mm</F>. <OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>But</OL>, <F>em</F> if I find someone who is very comfortable to talk with, that'll be good to talk with <F>em</F> the person in this kind of situation, though.</B>
<A>O K. Can you describe one restaurant that <F>er</F> you used to go in <H pn="others2">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B><F>Em</F>. O K. <F>Em</F>. I often <v_tns odr="1" crr="went">go</v_tns> to <at odr="2" crr="a">the</at> <F>em</F> Thai restaurant. This <av_pst odr="2" crr="mostly serves Thai food"><v_agr odr="1" crr="serves">serve</v_agr> Thai food mostly</av_pst>. But many people including Americans, African people, all of the people come to that restaurant because <F>mm</F> they have <o_odr odr="2" crr="good, delicious food"><n_cnt odr="1" crr="good food">a good food</n_cnt>, delicious</o_odr>. And also, they have a very <F>em</F> different atmosphere <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="from">than</prp_lxc1> other restaurants. <F>Mm</F>. People <v_lxc odr="1" crr="feel">are</v_lxc> like staying inside the sea. And <SC><?>used to</?> <F>eh</F> see the <F>em</F> big <F>em</F> fish or</SC> <at odr="1" crr="">the</at> big fish, or <at odr="2" crr="">the</at> shrimps and something you can find in the sea. <F>Em</F>. On the <n_num odr="1" crr="ceiling">ceilings</n_num>, that's a, you know, <F>eh</F> <pn_agr odr="2" crr="they">it</pn_agr> <v_agr odr="3" crr="are" ch="2">'s</v_agr> not <at odr="4" crr="">a</at> real fish, but <F>em</F> <SC>you seem</SC> you <v_lxc odr="6" crr="feel"><v_agr odr="5" crr="seem">seems</v_agr></v_lxc> like you are staying inside the sea. So <F>em</F> that <SC><?>as</?> me</SC> atmosphere makes people very comfortable. And it was <F>eh</F> <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> very <F>em</F> nice place to stay <prp_lxc1 odr="2" crr="">in</prp_lxc1> and talk to people. And <SC>you can</SC> <R>you</R> you <v_lxc odr="1" crr="feel">seem</v_lxc> like <F>em</F> coming to the real sea.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Since you like <R>scu</R> scuba diving, that must be a very nice place for you.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>

<A><F>Eh</F> let's do a role play now. O K, O K. This one. Please take a look. When you are ready, I'll <v_lxc odr="1" crr="start">initiate</v_lxc> <at odr="2" crr="the">a</at> role play.</A>
<ctxt>The nterviewee is looking at the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. Right. So this is a phone conversation. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX04</H>.</A>
<B><H pn="A's name">XXX04</H>? O K.</B>
<A>Right. So, hi, this is <H pn="A's name">XXX04</H>.</A>
<B>Hello. This is <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>.</B>
<A>Hi, <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>.</A>
<B>Hi. I'm sorry. I have to apologize. Because <R>I</R> I was supposed to go to the dinner party, but I <v_tns odr="1" crr="can't">couldn't</v_tns>. <OL>I'm very sorry</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F> <?>really</?></OL>? <?>But, what</?> happened to you?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> <F>em</F>. <CO>My friend is <F>mm</F> living</CO>. <F>Ah</F>. I have a roommate. And <F>em</F> she got a car crash, and <SC>she</SC> <F>eh</F> when I was supposed to come to you, she called me <F>em</F> from the police station. So I had to go. <R>I</R> I was in a panic. So I should have called you, but I didn't have time, and <R>I didn't</R> <SC>I didn't</SC> I couldn't <o_lxc odr="1" crr="">be able to</o_lxc> <SC>think up</SC> come up with <av_pst odr="2" crr="even that idea">that idea even</av_pst>. So <F>em</F> I think I should, but <F>em</F> I'm feeling sorry now, and I'm still a little bit upset.</B>
<A>I understand. Right. There <v_tns odr="1" crr="were">are</v_tns> some people who were here just to see you, and they were terribly disappointed.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. That's sad. <F>Ah</F>. Who <v_tns odr="1" crr="was">is</v_tns> talking about me?</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. Those friends from New Zealand who came just to see you.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. I wanted to see them, too. <F>Em</F>. I am very sorry about that. But, if you <SC>have</SC> <v_tns odr="1" crr="have">had</v_tns> another <n_num odr="2" crr="chance">chances</n_num> to have this kind of dinner party, I'd like to go. So, <F>em</F> if you have any chances, please tell me about that.</B>
<A>O K. Sure. <OL><F>Em</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Thank you</OL> very much.</B>
<A>Right. <F>Em</F>. But, tell me more about your friend. <F>Er</F>. <R>How</R> how is he or she? <F>Er</F>.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <F>em</F>. <CO>He got injured his</CO>. No. I said "my roommate", so she got injured, <SC>he</SC> <SC>she</SC> <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="in"></prp_lxc1> her legs. And she is still in <at odr="1" crr="the">a</at> hospital. But <F>em</F> her sister and her mother <v_tns odr="2" crr="came"><v_agr odr="1" crr="were">was</v_agr> coming</v_tns> up to <H pn="others2">XXX03</H>, so <SC>she is still</SC> <R>she is</R> she is now all right with them. But I'm still <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> going to see her in hospital each day, I mean, <F>em</F> every other day. So, now, we are all right. But we are still in some trouble. But we can make it.</B>
<A>All right. I understand. I'm sorry about your roommate. So, next time, please come.</A>
<B>Sure. I promise. And <F>em</F> <SC>I never forget you to <F>em</F> <R>s</R> return our <R>say</R> say</SC> I <v_tns odr="1" crr="will never forget">never forget</v_tns> to <v_lxc odr="2" crr="tell">say</v_lxc> <SC>what</SC> what <v_tns odr="3" crr="happens">'s happened</v_tns> to me. So I'm not gonna <v_lxc odr="1" crr="be"></v_lxc> upset you.</B>
<A>Right. O K. Thank you.</A>

</task>
<followup>
<A>Right. <F>Em</F>. Do you enjoy going to parties?</A>
<B>Parties? Yeah. Informal one, though.</B>
<A>Informal one? <?>So</?>, <F>mm</F> can you tell me the differences or similarities between parties</A>
<B><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>you</R></OL> <F>er</F> you participated in <H pn="others2">XXX03</H></A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>.</B>
<A>and parties that you go in Japan?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yes. Actually, I don't usually go to any parties in Japan. <F>Em</F>. Maybe, I don't think that's a party. I mean when I was <R>in</R> in <H pn="others2">XXX03</H>, we had a very very small party often. <F>Em</F>. <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="With">Among</prp_lxc1> five or six people or something like that. And, <F>em</F> <o_uit odr="2">if you <v_cmp odr="1" crr="say that">say about that</v_cmp></o_uit> I sometimes have a party in Japan. But <R>I don't</R> I don't <SC>like</SC> <v_lxc odr="1" crr="doubt">amaze</v_lxc> that is a party. So, maybe, <F>mm</F> I cannot say the difference well. But I'm thinking, I guess, the <F>em</F> difference is that, maybe, <F>mm</F> people staying in <F>em</F> the Western countries <SC>say</SC> like to say they want to have a party or something like that. They want to send a greeting card, and they also like to receive it. And <SC>they feel</SC> <F>em</F> they want to go to <at odr="1" crr="a">their</at> party on the weekend. And, they want to <v_lxc odr="2" crr="enjoy">feel <prp_cmp odr="1" crr="like enjoying">like be <F>eh</F> enjoying</prp_cmp></v_lxc>. <F>Em</F>. I <v_lxc odr="1" crr="learned" crr2="knew">thought</v_lxc> that kind of idea. Because I was a student, so, <F>em</F> <SC>on</SC> from Monday to Friday, we <v_tns odr="1" crr="had">have</v_tns> classes. And, on the weekend, we enjoyed a party. That's the <F>em</F> usual thing <F>eh</F> for college <n_num odr="1" crr="students">student</n_num>. <CO>I thought <SC>in the U S</SC> the life I had in the U S</CO>. And <F>mm</F> I don't know. <F>Mm</F>. Anyway, that's it. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

<A>I'll show you a last picture today.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>.</B>
<A>And, O K. This one. So this is a story. This is the beginning. And that's the ending. And <F>eh</F> I'd like you to come up with your own story based on these pictures, and beginning with "one day last week". Because <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> story took place in the past.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures.</ctxt>
<B>O K. I'll try.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-hum</F>.</A>
<B>One day last week, <SC>I was</SC> <R>I went</R> I went camping with my roommate. And <R>we are</R> we <v_tns odr="1" crr="were">are</v_tns> ready to go and <v_tns odr="2" crr="packed">packing</v_tns> other <n_num odr="3" crr="things">thing</n_num> like small bags, <con_lxc odr="4" crr="">and</con_lxc> <F>er</F> <n_cnt odr="5" crr="equipment">equipments</n_cnt> for the <??></??> and <at odr="6" crr="">a</at> working chairs. And we put everything on our car. As soon as <R>we</R> we reached <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> riverside, we <v_lxc odr="2" crr="pitched">built</v_lxc> a tent. And <R>we</R> we tried to have <at odr="1" crr="">a</at> dinner along the riverside. So we made <o_lxc odr="1" crr="curry and rice">rice and curry</o_lxc>, <SC>on fire</SC> with fire. And everything was fine until then. But, suddenly, <SC>a rain is</SC> we saw <at odr="1" crr="the">a</at> rain <v_lxc odr="2" crr="falling">coming down</v_lxc>. <SC>So</SC> and then, the rain <v_tns odr="1" crr="was getting">is <v_lxc odr="2" crr="falling">getting</v_lxc></v_tns> very hard, so we couldn't stay there. Then, we got on the car. <.></.> We wanted to have <at odr="2" crr="the" ch="1"></at> <n_num odr="1" crr="tent">tents</n_num>, <con_lxc odr="3" crr="">and</con_lxc> the chairs and <F>eh</F> <n_lxc odr="4" crr="plates">eating bowls</n_lxc> or something like that, but, we couldn't have time to collect all of them. So <SC>we left</SC> <SC>we had to left</SC> we <v_tns odr="1" crr="had to leave">have to leave</v_tns> all of our stuff. But, anyway, we got <prp_lxc2 odr="1" crr="on"></prp_lxc2> <at odr="2" crr="the">a</at> car. And <R>we</R> <R>we</R> we could get away from the rain. And we tried to find somewhere to stay <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="">in</prp_lxc1>. Because <SC>we were</SC> <SC>ha</SC> we were very wet. And we wanted to stay in a calm place. Then, we finally found a <R>hotel</R> hotel. <??></??>. So we got in, and, finally, we got into <at odr="1" crr="a">the</at> very safe room. And we were <R>sitting</R> sitting together and looking outside from the room. The outside <v_tns odr="1" crr="was still raining">is still raining</v_tns>, and the rain <v_tns odr="2" crr="was">is</v_tns> still hard. So <SC>it was a</SC> I thought it was a good idea not to stay <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="at">in</prp_lxc1> the riverside for a long time. But the thing is that we <SC>should have so</SC> should have seen the weather broadcast. <.></.> That's it.</B>
