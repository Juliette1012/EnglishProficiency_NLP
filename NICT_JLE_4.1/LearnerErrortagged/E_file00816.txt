<A>So thank you <SC>for</SC> <F>er</F> very much for coming here. How are you today?</A>
<B>Fine. <laughter><F>Um</F></laughter> I'm <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> little nervous. <SC>I've</SC> I haven't taken a <nvs>tsk</nvs> <F>er</F> language test for <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> long time, <laughter>so</laughter></B>
<A><F>Err</F>.</A>

<A>Yeah?</A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>

<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>

<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I can't</OL> really give up working,</B>

<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>They're honest</OL>. <??></??>. And <R>I don't need to</R> <F>um</F> I don't need to behave like as if I were <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="with"></prp_lxc1> other people. <CO>Like</CO>. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hum</F> I see</OL>.</A>

Anyway <R>so they</R> so <SC>they</SC> <F>um</F> some of them decided to stay. <laughter>So that's how <SC>I got to</SC> I got those</laughter> cats, but <F>uh</F> <R>the</R> they're at my mother's <n_lxc odr="1" crr="house"></n_lxc>. <R>I</R> I live alone in my apartment, <R>so</R> <F>um</F> <laughter><SC>so this</SC></laughter> <SC>I</SC> you know, like when I see my mother, I can see those cats as well.</B>

<stage2>
<task>
<A><F>Uum</F> first thing today,</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>I'm going to show you a picture. O K. So could you describe this picture?</A>
<B>I suppose this is a classroom situation. And <F>er</F> <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>these age group</SC> <F>oh</F> <SC>there's</SC> <SC>their</SC> <R>the</R> their age <n_num odr="1" crr="groups">group</n_num> vary. <F>Er</F> some of them are probably <F>oh</F> in their thirties and some of them are <F>um</F> in their late teens. So <?>th</?> <SC>there</SC> this is like <F>er</F> <.></.> <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> high school <F>er</F> where <R>the</R> <SC>the</SC> high school <SC>s</SC> <F>uum</F> dropouts can <F>um</F> start studying again to get their high school diplomas, I guess. <OL><CO>I just</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> <at odr="2" crr="a" ch="1"></at> <n_num odr="1" crr="teacher">teachers</n_num> looks nervous.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Actually</OL> <R>she remains me of</R> she reminds me of <laughter><o_uk odr="1" crr="my current situation">myself right now</o_uk></laughter>.</B>
<A>Really?</A>
<B><laughter><CO>Or</CO></laughter>. Yeah. <?>As <F>er</F></?> <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="she"></pn_lxc> gets nervous and <F>er</F> <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> students are not really interested in <F>er</F> studying English. And <F>er</F> they remind me of my students. <laughter><CO>So like</CO></laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. O K. Yeah. Thank you very much.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Then, what do you think about these students' <n_num odr="1" crr="attitudes">attitude</n_num>?</A>
<B><.></.> <F>Well</F> <R>they</R> <F>um</F> <.></.> <SC>they arn</SC> <R>they</R> <SC>they are apprehens</SC> <?><F>well</F></?> they don't wanna study anything and then <SC>but <F>er</F> I suppose that</SC> <F>er</F> yeah, I don't know. Just <F>um</F> I don't want to be too judgmental but <F>er</F> if this teacher is more interesting or more motivating, they may be interested in studying. <SC>If</SC> I mean, and then also if she <v_cmp odr="2" crr="makes the class"><v_lxc odr="1" crr="makes">is</v_lxc></v_cmp> more student-centered or whatever, because <SC>that</SC> <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> it seems like, to me, <SC>they're</SC> <SC>they</SC> I mean, <R>they</R> <SC>they</SC> I don't know really what's going on but, <F>er</F> <R>they</R> <R>they</R> they decided to study again.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>um</F> I cannot really blame students too much and teachers are responsible for their motivations as well.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. Then, how do you manage your class if your students are like this?</A>
<B><laughter>I don't know</laughter>. <.></.> <F>Um</F> <R>I</R> I think, <at odr="1" crr="">the</at> <F>er</F> first of all, that the material should be <F>er</F> more interesting. <R>And the</R> <SC>and the also the</SC> <F>er</F> <nvs>tsk</nvs> <F>well</F> I don't know. <F>Um</F> <.></.> <F>uum</F>. <nvs>tsk</nvs> It's a good question. <laughter>I never thought <prp_lxc2 odr="1" crr="">of</prp_lxc2></laughter> how I would manage this class. <F>Uum</F>. <.></.> Yeah, <??></??> the material should be <F>um</F> something that <F>er</F> they can learn without too <aj_lxc odr="1" crr="many">much</aj_lxc> problems. And the materials should be related to the daily <F>well</F> situations. <SC?>In a s</SC?> <R?>I</R?> I'm not saying <R>every s</R> every single thing that <F>uh</F> she teaches should be <F>er</F> <R>that the</R> <.></.> <SC>that the</SC> <F>um</F> <F>um</F> related to the daily life, but <R>some of them</R> <SC>some of them</SC> some should be <F>er</F> something that <F>er</F> they can relate themselves to very <av_lxc odr="1" crr="much">well</av_lxc>. <F>Mm</F>. But <SC>the</SC> I really like this picture because <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> <av_lxc odr="1" crr="usually">lot of times</av_lxc> <SC>that</SC> <F>uh</F> <R>in</R> in <at odr="2" crr="">a</at> Japanese <F>um</F> <R>ma</R> <R>ma</R> <F>er</F> materials, <SC>that</SC> <at odr="3" crr="">the</at> <o_odr odr="4" crr="all teachers">teachers all</o_odr> <mo_lxc odr="5" crr="">has to</mo_lxc> <v_fml odr="6" crr="are">be</v_fml> always men, but <SC>this is</SC> <R>this</R> this <v_agr odr="7" crr="happens">happen</v_agr> to be a woman.</B>

<B>O K. Mister Suzuki <F>uum</F> went to the station to get to work. That was around eight. And <F>er</F> <R>he was waiting</R> he was waiting <SC>for the</SC> for his train to come <F>uum</F> impatiently. <SC>But</SC> <SC>and <F>er</F> at</SC> <F>um</F> <nvs>tsk</nvs> while <v_lxc odr="1" crr="waiting">doing that</v_lxc>, <SC>he was kind of <F>um</F> ner</SC> he was kind of <F>er</F> <nvs>tsk</nvs> <F>uum</F> thinking about what he <v_tns odr="2" crr="would have to">has to</v_tns> do <R>at</R> at work. He <v_tns odr="1" crr="had">has</v_tns> a big project to do. So he was, I guess, <SC>su</SC> <F>ah</F> very <F>um</F> careless.
