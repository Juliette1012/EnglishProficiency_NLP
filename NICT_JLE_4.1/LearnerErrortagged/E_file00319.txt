<A><F>Eh</F>. What are the names of your <aj_inf odr="1" crr="favorite">most favorite</aj_inf> authors?</A>
<B>I don't really have <F>er</F> favorite authors. I am just <v_fml odr="1" crr="picking">pick</v_fml> up anything.

<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><R>I was</R> I was <F>er</F> getting tired of living abroad. So <F>em</F> I wanted to <R>come home</R> come home to my family. But, at the same time, I wasn't sure if I <mo_lxc odr="1" crr="can">'ll</mo_lxc> live in Japan. So I was little bit nervous too. So.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>

<A><OL>O K</OL>. Let me show you <at odr="1" crr="the">a</at> first picture today. <F>Em</F>. This one.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Please describe what you see <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="in"></prp_lxc1> this picture.</A>
<B>O K. There are a lot of people. <F>Em</F>. One, two, three women are skiing. <F>Em</F>. And three men are skiing. <SC>There are</SC> I think <pn_agr odr="1" crr="they">it</pn_agr> <v_agr odr="2" crr="are" ch="1">'s</v_agr> kids. But four kids are playing, <F>eh</F> I don't know how to call this, <F>em</F> I don't know, <o_lxc odr="1" crr="snowball fight">snow <laughter>ball war</o_lxc></laughter> or something? I don't know how to <v_lxc odr="1" crr="call">say</v_lxc> it. <SC>But</SC> <F>em</F> and one man is snow boarding. And <F>er</F> <SC>I think</SC> I know maybe this is a ski class or something. <SC>The</SC> a person on the right corner, he looks like a teacher, like giving instruction. And <F>er</F> there is a lift. And <F>em</F> there is a lodge. And two people are having a break, maybe coffee break or something. And there is a car parked in front of <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> lodge.

<A>O K. <F>Am</F>. Have you gone skiing in <H pn="others5">XXX06</H>?</A>
<B><F>Eh</F>. Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. O K. Have you gone skiing in Japan, too?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. No, not yet. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Not yet. <F>Oh</F>. What was it like? <F>Er</F>. Skiing in <H pn="others5">XXX06</H>? Can you describe it?</A>
<B><F>Em</F>. <SC>The best</SC> I think the best thing was that it was really close, <F>em</F> maybe twenty minutes by car.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-hum</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> it was cheap, too. <F>Em</F>. You pay maybe twenty dollars for <SC>rents</SC> <F>eh</F> renting <n_num odr="1" crr="skis">ski</n_num>, <con_lxc odr="2" crr="">and</con_lxc> <F>er</F> a lift and everything. And, you can ski all day if you <v_cmp odr="1" crr="want to">want it to</v_cmp>. So <?>easy</?>. <F>Em</F>. We used to go after class, so, maybe like <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="from"></prp_lxc1> <n_lxc odr="2" crr="early-evening">evening</n_lxc> <prp_lxc1 odr="3" crr="until">to</prp_lxc1> <con_lxc odr="4" crr="">and</con_lxc> <av_lxc odr="5" crr="">then</av_lxc> <con_lxc odr="6" crr="">when</con_lxc> it gets dark. They, <F>em</F> <v_lxc odr="1" crr="turn">try</v_lxc> the lights on. So, you can even ski at night. And <F>er</F> a lot of locals come to ski. So, it was fun.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>.</B>
<A>Sounds very nice. <F>Mhm</F>. Can you imagine the difference between <F>er</F> this kind of skiing place in the States and the same <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="one"></pn_lxc> in Japan?</A>
<B><F>Em</F> <SC>I've been to <F>em</F> sk</SC> <R>I</R> I <v_tns odr="1" crr="went skiing">'ve been skiing</v_tns> in Japan, <SC>f</SC> I mean, <o_lxc odr="2" crr="for a long time">long time ago</o_lxc>. So, it's <o_lxc odr="1" crr="kind of">kind</o_lxc> hard, <R>to</R> to remember. But <F>em</F> I think, in Japan, <SC>it's</SC> it was a little bit crowded, compared to <F>eh</F> <F>em</F> <SC>the States</SC> <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> one in the States. <F>Em</F>. And <SC>I think</SC> I don't think <R>it's</R> <F>em</F> it's a requirement. But everyone has to wear a ski uniform, <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> kind of thing. <F>Em</F>. In the States, no one <v_agr odr="1" crr="wears">wear</v_agr> <F>eh</F> <at odr="3" crr="a"></at> ski <n_lxc odr="2" crr="uniform">thing</n_lxc> <con_lxc odr="4" crr="while">like</con_lxc> <SC>they</SC> <R>we</R> we used to wear jeans pants and <n_num odr="5" crr="jackets">jacket</n_num>. And then, it <v_tns odr="1" crr="is">was</v_tns> fine, too. So I think that was the main difference.</B>

<B><F>Well</F>. I can put up some <n_num odr="1" crr="boards">board</n_num>. But, still it's dangerous. I mean, anyone can come in. So, <?><o_uk odr="1" crr="why can't you">what don't can you</o_uk></?> come tonight?</B>

<A><F>Eh</F>. What kind of place have you lived in the States?</A>
<B><F>Em</F>. First I lived in <at odr="1" crr="the">a</at> dormitory. And then, <F>em</F> first two years I lived in dormitory. But, during the summer time, <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="we">you</pn_lxc> had to move out of the dormitory.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>They close the dormitory.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>So I had to live in an apartment. So I used to share with <F>eh</F> <at odr="1" crr="an"></at> American student.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>And</SC> so after that, I <F>em</F> moved to <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> dormitory.</B>

<A><F>Mhm</F>. Did you have any <F>er</F> serious <n_num odr="1" crr="problems">problem</n_num>, <F>er</F> while you were at <at odr="2" crr="the">a</at> dormitory?</A>
<B><F>Em</F>. Not when I was in <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> dormitory. No, <F>em</F> <SC>the</SC> not serious. <at odr="1" crr="A"></at> <cap odr="2" crr="minor" ch="1">Minor</cap> one was maybe <F>em</F> <con_lxc odr="3" crr="that"></con_lxc> neighbors <mo_lxc odr="4" crr="were"></mo_lxc> making too much noise and <?>stuff</?>. But, usually, <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="we">you</pn_lxc> didn't have to report it. <pn_lxc odr="1" crr="We">You</pn_lxc> just banged a window, I mean, <laughter>bunged</laughter> the wall.

<A>Did you have any <n_num odr="1" crr="problems">problem</n_num> after all, <SC>so</SC> <F>em</F> when you were in <at odr="2" crr="the">an</at> apartment?</A>
<B><F>Em</F>. I can't really remember. Maybe, <F>em</F> some minor problems like, you know, <rel_lxc odr="1" crr="">what</rel_lxc> water doesn't drain or something like that. <F>Em</F>. But it's not really the apartment problem. But, once, my <F>eh</F> A T M card got stolen. And someone <v_tns odr="1" crr="used">use</v_tns> it. And my money was gone. <F>Em</F>.

<A>I see.</A>
<B>Because it was <at odr="1" crr="an"></at> old building. So <F>em</F> they didn't have <F>eh</F> locks on the <F>em</F> post box. <F>Mm</F>.</B>

<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Em</F>. He went to the station, and he was <R>s</R> <F>eh</F> waiting for the train at the platform.

And <F>er</F> one guy <mo_lxc odr="1" crr="">is</mo_lxc> <F>er</F> hit <H pn="A's name">XXX07</H>'s hand, and his <F>eh</F> suitcase dropped <prp_lxc2 odr="2" crr="to">into</prp_lxc2> the <o_lxc odr="3" crr="rail track">train track</o_lxc>.

And he was very relieved, because there was <at odr="1" crr="an"></at> important document in his suitcase. Without it, <F>em</F> he couldn't make his presentation <o_lxc odr="1" crr="that day">today</o_lxc>. <F>Em</F>.

<A><F>Em</F> can you describe <F>er</F> the transportation system of <?>the part of</?> <H pn="others5">XXX06</H> where you lived?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <F>em</F>. Public transportation system? <F>Em</F>. It's not great like <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="in"></prp_lxc1> Japan, or <F>eh</F> it's a small city. <F>Em</F>. So there was <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> bus and <F>er</F> Amtrak. But, <R>what</R> only when you are going <F>er</F> further way, not in the city, there is no train. <F>Em</F>. So <R>you</R> mainly you have to take <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> bus. But <F>er</F> <R>the bus</R> all the <n_num odr="1" crr="buses">bus</n_num> <o_lxc odr="3" crr="go round"><v_agr odr="2" crr="go">goes</v_agr> rounding</o_lxc> and go to downtown. And, if you want to go <prp_lxc2 odr="1" crr="to"></prp_lxc2> <at odr="2" crr="a"></at> different direction, you have to change your <n_num odr="3" crr="trains">train</n_num> once in downtown and go to <at odr="4" crr="the"></at> different direction. So it's really <F>er</F> time consuming. And, <F>er</F> if you wanna go shopping, <F>em</F> you have to carry all the staff. So it was <F>eh</F> difficult. <F>Em</F>. There is <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> taxi, too. But, not so many, <R>you can</R> you can call <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> cab, but <F>em</F> you have to wait for a long time.
