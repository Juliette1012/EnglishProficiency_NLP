<B><F>Um</F>. Actually, I didn't study <F>er</F> about <F>er</F> architecture which you think this is architecture. I studied <F>er</F> earthquakes since Japan has a lot of earthquakes. Yeah. <SC>And</SC> <F>er</F> but I'm in <F>er</F> <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> architectural <n_lxc odr="1" crr="development">develop</n_lxc> <R>de</R> department. <?>I <v_tns odr="2" crr="studied"><v_vo odr="1" crr="study">'m</?> studied</v_vo></v_tns> about earthquakes.</B>
<A>That's interesting. <SC>How</SC> <F>uh</F> why did you become interested in earthquakes?</A>

<B>How can we solve it? <F>Mm</F>. <SC>It's</SC> <SC>if</SC> it's difficult. <F>Er</F>. But, <F>er</F> at first, <R>we</R> we have to think about the <R>infras</R> <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> infrastructure. But <F>er</F> <SC>al</SC> infrastructure has <R>alre</R> <SC>already</SC> been builted already. So it's difficult to change it.
