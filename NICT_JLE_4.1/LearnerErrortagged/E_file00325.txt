<B><F>Ah</F>. This is <F>em</F> the scene of the room. Perhaps, the private room of the lady, <F>em</F> <SC>studying</SC> maybe, <F>em</F> <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> study room. And <SC>she is</SC> now <SC>she'll to whom</SC> she is <v_fml odr="1" crr="showing">show</v_fml> her personal computer, but she is sitting at the desk in front of the computer. And she has two pets.

But, <SC>my</SC> perhaps, she's a writer or a translator or something. Maybe, she works at home.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Em</F>. Could you compare this room in the picture with your own room?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> This is similar to my room except for two pets. I don't have pets. <F>Em</F>. And, <SC>even if I had a</SC> <F>eh</F> even if I had pets or companion <n_num odr="1" crr="animals">animal</n_num>, if you may say, I would not have them inside of my room or even in the house.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-hum</F>. <F>Em</F>. <R>Wh</R> why is that?</A>
<B><F>Eh</F>. Because my father is a medical doctor. And <SC>she doesn't like</SC> he doesn't like to have <at odr="1" crr="">the</at> animals inside of the house</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><SC>for the</SC> what you call it, <F>em</F> <F>er</F> <SC>for cep</SC> <R>for</R> for the reasons that he <v_agr odr="2" crr="thinks">think</v_agr>, <SC>that may afford</SC> that may affect his work.</B>

<A><F>Oh</F>. I understand. O K. Right. Do you have a computer?</A>
<B>Yes, I do.</B>
<A><F>Eh</F>. What do you use that for?</A>
<B><R>I</R> <F>em</F> I use it for <F>em</F> <SC>s</SC> translation <n_lxc odr="1" crr="work">purposes</n_lxc>. Sometimes, I do the part time work <SC>for <R>t</R> tran</SC> by translating</B>
<A><F>Eh</F>.</A>
<B>something.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>And I do have to <F>eh</F> prepare the assignments that <SC>I'm assign</SC> <R>I</R> I'm given by the <H pn="school name1">XXX07</H> that I go.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Do you think the use of computer has changed the way <R>you</R> you do your job, especially translation?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. Yes, of course. <SC>It's</SC> <F>eh</F> <R>it</R> <F>er</F> it helps me to shorten the <F>eh</F> preparation time. <SC>And</SC> but there is <at odr="1" crr="a">other</at> minor part, <F>er</F> which is I tend to forget the Chinese <?>and</?> Japanese characters. <SC>That's the bad</SC> that's a minor part.</B>
