<A>Which do you like better to live <prp_lxc2 odr="1" crr="in"></prp_lxc2> Singapore or in Japan?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. Of course, in Japan. Because I was born in Japan, and I know the culture itself. <F>Mm</F>. But it was quite interesting to live <prp_lxc2 odr="1" crr="">in</prp_lxc2> abroad. And, especially, <SC>it was</SC> <o_uk odr="1" crr="it is interesting to live in Asia">it's in Asia</o_uk>, it's in <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> other country, but, <SC>with</SC> still, <SC>with</SC> in Asia, <SC>I</SC> we have many <aj_lxc odr="3" crr="similar">same</aj_lxc> cultures to share, but it's different. It was quite interesting.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. I see. O K. So, do you speak Dutch, too?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. A little bit.</B>
<A>A little bit?</A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Ah-huh</F>. What is your hobby?</A>
<B>My hobby? <F>Ah</F>. In this season, skiing. And then, these days, I started <F>er</F> playing <n_lxc odr="1" crr="billiards">billiard</n_lxc>.</B>
<A>Billiards?</A>
<B>Billiards.</B>
<A><F>Ah-huh</F>.</A>
<B><SC>It's</SC> <SC>I ju</SC> I'm just <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> beginner. Really <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> beginner. Very beginner. But it's really interesting. I really want to play.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Why did you decide to start billiards?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. <R>One</R> one of my friends <v_agr odr="1" crr="is">are</v_agr> crazy about <n_lxc odr="2" crr="billiards">billiard</n_lxc>. Then he <v_tns odr="1" crr="recommended">recommend</v_tns> us to join <at odr="3" crr="">the</at> <n_lxc odr="2" crr="billiards">billiard</n_lxc>.</B>

<B>Difficult?</B>
<A><F>Ah-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. <SC>I really</SC> I <v_lxc odr="1" crr="am"></v_lxc> still not sure about <SC>the</SC> how difficult or how much interesting it is. But I think, <F>er</F> <F>er</F> now, I <mo_lxc odr="1" crr="am"></mo_lxc> still practicing to push straight <prp_lxc2 odr="2" crr="towards"></prp_lxc2> where <SC>I want to</SC> I want <v_fin odr="3" crr="to let">let</v_fin> the ball go. But, <SC>now</SC> <F>mm</F> maybe, later on, maybe, I have to think about <F>er</F> physics. But, yeah, that's quite interesting.</B>
