<A>O K. Thank you very much. Your room is like this?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. No, my room is not as <laughter>big as this</laughter>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Yes. <F>Erm</F>. And <F>er</F> <F>well</F> I have no space for such a big desk. But I have a bed and <F>er</F> a small table and T V <F>um</F> near the window.</B>
<A>If you were to move to <at odr="1" crr="a"></at> new apartment or something, how do you <F>um</F> usually find a good place?</A>
<B>Good place? <F>Hm</F> <F>well</F> <F>well</F>. Actually, I've been in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H> for nearly two years, <SC>so</SC> but I'm not really familiar with the areas in <F>er</F> different places. So, <F>um</F> maybe, <F>um</F> I ask one of the <n_num odr="1" crr="agencies">agency</n_num>. Actually, I found <SC>my place</SC> <F>ur</F> <at odr="2" crr="the"></at> current <n_num odr="1" crr="places">place</n_num> <F>um</F> through the agency, too. And she is really good. The person in charge was very kind, and <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>um</F> I can just give her all information I want. And she could arrange almost everything. <F>Em</F>. So <F>erm</F> I might try that way again.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <SC>If you were</SC> if you find <F>er</F> two good place, <F>oh</F> how do you decide which one to take?</A>
<B>Which one to take? <F>Hm</F>. First of all, <F>er</F> whether it's <F>er</F> convenient <SC>to</SC> for commuting or not. Secondly, <F>er</F> <.></.> the room itself. <F>Erm</F> <F>er</F>. <SC>I</SC> <?>that's</?> more <aj_lxc odr="1" crr="important">importance</aj_lxc> to <v_lxc odr="2" crr="have"></v_lxc> the window <F>er</F> facing to the big road, or <F>um</F> <.></.> I really don't want to take the place <F>um</F> with the window <F>er</F> just close to the <SC>another building</SC> <aj_lxc odr="3" crr="other">another <OL>side of</aj_lxc> <at odr="4" crr="" ch="3">the</at> building</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah, I don't like that, too</OL>, yeah.</A>
<B>So, <F>er</F> in that case, I wouldn't take it.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. That's a good point.</A>

<A><F>Oh</F>. Fine, but we were waiting.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <F>er</F>. I'm so sorry. I'm working right now. And then, I cannot leave the office.</B>
<A>But <F>er</F> <at odr="1" crr="the"></at> party is already starting, and you could have called us.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. I'm so sorry, but I was engaged <F>er</F> on the phone. And then, <F>erm</F> probably, I have to finish my report. <F>Um</F>. It might take a while. So I'm terribly sorry, but, yeah, I can't make it tonight.</B>
<A><F>Er</F>. Yeah, <F>oh</F> I understand you, but <F>er</F> this <SC>is</SC> was a <SC>surprise for you</SC> surprise party for you <OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>. Thank you very much. <F>Um</F>. I really appreciate what you <v_inf odr="1" crr="did">doed</v_inf> for me, but, <F>um</F> <F>well</F> frankly speaking, I cannot make it today. And, can I make it up some other time?</B>

</task>
<followup>
<A>Have you ever had this kind of experience?</A>
<B><F>Err</F>. <SC>For the</SC> you mean, I missed the party?</B>
<A>Or anything you sort of missed <at odr="1" crr="an"></at> appointment with your friends. <CO>Or</CO>.</A>
<B>Yes. Actually, one of my <n_num odr="1" crr="friends">friend</n_num> <F>er</F> was waiting for me in the restaurant <av_lxc odr="2" crr="alone">by herself</av_lxc>. And I was supposed to be there, but <F>er</F> <SC>I</SC> yeah, I really couldn't make it, because <F>er</F> my boss asked me to do some <F>er</F> job. And <F>er</F> I mean, which I wasn't expected. And <F>er</F> I couldn't say "No.". So, <F>um</F> in that case, I rang her <prp_lxc1 odr="1" crr="up"></prp_lxc1> at the restaurant. <F>Um</F> <F>eh</F>. She's already had <F>um</F> <aj_qnt odr="1" crr="some">small amount of</aj_qnt> meal on the table. And she said, "<F>Oh</F>.". Yeah, she was a bit upset. <nvs>laughter</nvs> But, <F>um</F> <F>hm</F> <F>well</F> after that, I explained her and how I was <F>er</F> and what the situation was. So she understood.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>And, <F>er</F> yeah, <F>er</F> I made it up <laughter>for her</laughter>. So, then, it was O K.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. What do you think about the people who value work mostly?</A>
<B>Mostly? <F>Erm</F> <F>well</F>. <R>Wh</R> when you are required, <F>well</F> you cannot say "No.". <R>But</R> but, although <F>er</F> you cannot say "No." to your boss. I mean, <F>um</F> for example, <con_lxc odr="1" crr="if"></con_lxc> the job <v_vo odr="2" crr="was offered">offered</v_vo> to you, you <OL>can't miss it</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah, yeah</OL>.</A>
<B>But <F>erm</F> <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I want to have a policy of my job. So, maybe, say, even if my boss said to do this or that, <F>er</F> <R>if</R> <.></.> if <av_lxc odr="1" crr="there"></av_lxc> <v_lxc odr="2" crr="is"></v_lxc> something wrong with it <F>er</F> or if <F>er</F> something <mo_lxc odr="3" crr="might">will</mo_lxc> happen in the future, <R>I</R> I might tell my boss, because <SC>my</SC> <SC>maybe, I</SC> I might know my work <F>er</F> better than <SC>he does</SC> he or she does. <CO>So</CO>.</B>

<A>Here we go.</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. One day last week, <F>erm</F> a man drove <F>er</F> along the beach. <nvs>sniff</nvs> And, <F>er</F> <F>er</F> from the opposite side of the road, <F>er</F> there was a man <R>dri</R> <F>ee</F> <o_lxc odr="1" crr="riding on a bike">driving <SC>the <F>er</F> motorcycle</SC> <F>er</F> <at odr="2" crr="a">the</at> bike</o_lxc>.</B>

<A><F>Mm</F>. Why <v_qst odr="1" crr="don't you take">you don't take</v_qst> a license?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. It's <at odr="2" crr="a" ch="1"></at> very stupid <n_num odr="1" crr="thing">things</n_num>, but <F>er</F> <F>em</F> I went to a fortuneteller long time ago.

<A><F>Oh</F>. No, no for me. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Thank you. <F>Er</F>. I was told that <F>er</F> if I drove a car, I might have killed somebody in a traffic accident. So I didn't want it to happen.</B>
<A>Do you <v_fml odr="1" crr="believe">believing</v_fml> fortune telling?</A>
<B><F>Well</F>. Usually, I don't. But, in this case, it involves somebody's life. So, <F>er</F> yes. I was very scared.</B>
<A><OL><CO>How about</CO></OL>?</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> then, I can <v_lxc odr="1" crr="live">do</v_lxc> without a <OL>car</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>, yeah. Yeah, that's right. How about for the big decisions in <SC>like</SC> life? For example, marriage or something. <CO>Do you still believe in</CO>?</A>
<B>In fortune telling?</B>
<A><F>Huh-uh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Err</F>. If it's <OL><at odr="2" crr="a" ch="1"></at> good <n_num odr="1" crr="thing">things</n_num> I <laughter>will believe it</laughter></OL>, but if it's bad, I'll try to <R>forg</R> <F>er</F> forget it.</B>
<A>What do you think about the <F>er</F> fortune telling sort of a marketing stuff? Because there <v_agr odr="1" crr="are">is</v_agr> <at odr="2" crr="">a</at> tons of fortune <n_num odr="3" crr="tellings">telling</n_num> which <v_agr odr="4" crr="are">is</v_agr> not really fortune telling. What do you think about those?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>mm</F>. Because I <v_tns odr="1" crr="tried">try</v_tns> <F>um</F> many fortunetellers, so, maybe, I think I can <F>er</F> figure out which is good and which is bad. <F>Um</F>. And, <F>er</F> if the fortuneteller says something completely different from what happened or <F>er</F> <prp_lxc2 odr="1" crr="from">for</prp_lxc2> my character, <F>mm</F> maybe I wouldn't believe it.</B>
<A>Yeah. You just <??></??>. Yeah.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. Yes.</B>
<A><F>Well</F>. I'll do the same.</A>
