<A>O K. I'm gonna start. Good afternoon. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>.</A>
<B>O K. Nice to meet you, <OL><H pn="A's name">XXX01</H></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><CO>Nice to m</CO></OL>. <?><F>Er</F> <F>em</F></?>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> my name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. O K. Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Yes. <OL>Go ahead, <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>How are</R> how are you</OL> today, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>I'm doing very well today. <F>Erm</F> I just got out of class, I just ate lunch and it's a beautiful day outside. I love this weather. Very sunny and quite warm for November.</B>
<A>Yeah, it is quite warm. What did you have for lunch?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I had a <JP>obento</JP> with <F>er</F> rice and beef. It was pretty good.</B>
<A>From the convenience store? <CO>Or</CO>?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> no. It was actually from the school cafeteria.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. There's a school cafeteria here?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>er</F> the school is very near to <R>this</R> this building.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><H pn="school name1">XXX03</H></OL>. It's <?>within</?> <F>mm</F> maybe five minutes walk.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see. <SC>This is</SC> so what's this place for?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> this is strictly for the <F>er</F> study-abroad students for the <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> program. <OL><CO><?>Whereas</?></CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><?>What about school</?></OL>?</A>
<B>And the school is <F>erm</F> filled with Japanese students, and then there's another study-abroad program for <F>erm</F> some other students. <.></.> But this building is for <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> students only.</B>
<A>O K. Now, <R>I</R> I really don't know anything about <H pn="others1">XXX04</H>. Can you explain little about it?</A>
<B><nvs>cough</nvs> <F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> it's a study-abroad program. <F>Er</F> it doesn't focus only on language, but also <F>erm</F> I'm really participating in the culture. And so we're also <F>er</F> placed in internship situations where we get to do ethnographies of social organizations here in Japan. For instance, I'm placed in the <H pn="company name1">XXX05</H>. And I go there every week on Wednesday, and spend about <.></.> five hours doing translation and helping with office work, like stuffing envelopes and making copies.</B>
<A><F>Eh</F> <F>uh</F> <SC>the</SC> <R>wh</R> what is this institute involved in?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <R>it's</R> it's there for the community. <F>Um</F> <H pn="others2">XXX06</H> is a very diverse place. As far as Japan goes, there's a lot of foreigners living there, and so <F>er</F> the <H pn="company name1">XXX05</H> helps to educate the Japanese about the other cultures, and helps to educate the other cultures about Japanese culture. And it's really interesting. But <R>they</R> they need <R>a</R> a lot of help with translations for the newsletters if they expect people to read them in English because everything is written in Japanese.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>So I'm trying to help out with that. But my Japanese is <.></.> a bit slow. So I'm not helping too much. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. <R>I</R> <SC>I'm sure <R>you</R> you are</SC> I'm sure <OL>you are</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>Where do you originally come from, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>I'm from <SC><H pn="others3">XXX07</H></SC> <H pn="others4">XXX08</H>, <H pn="others3">XXX07</H>,</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>.</A>
<B>in the United States.</B>
<A>Pretty cold at this time of the year.</A>
<B>Yes. It's already snowed there.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>It's very cold <laughter>there</laughter>.</B>
<A>Yeah. I've never <F>erm</F> been there. In fact, <F>erm</F> <F>er</F> in the winter, <R>wha</R> <R>wha</R> <SC>what do people do</SC> I mean how do they get through the winter?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> unlike Japan, <F>er</F> all the buildings are heated. They use a lot of central heating. <SC>And</SC> <.></.> so you're either in a warm bus or your warm car or you're inside a building that's heated. So unless you're walking outside, it's not very cold. But people wear large coats and a lot of clothing. And <R>it's</R> it's kind of dangerous to drive in the winter when there's a lot of snow on the roads. But people manage.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. This is much more comfortable.</A>
<B>Yes. This is much more comfortable. But the cold here is very different. It's very dry in <H pn="others3">XXX07</H>, and here, when it gets really cold, it almost seems like <R>it sink</R> it sinks through all of our clothing.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I feel like it's almost colder. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>I can understand that.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. I'm gonna do some things with you today. <F>Er</F> first of all, I wanna show you a picture.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>It's a picture of a restaurant.</A>
<B><??></??>.</B>
<A>And I'd like you to describe this picture in detail.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Well</F> it looks like a very fancy restaurant where the waiter is dressed up in a tuxedo and he's serving wine to the customers who are also very dressed up in <F>er</F> <.></.> formal dresses and suits. There's a really big grandfather clock against the wall. And next to it, a woman playing the piano so it looks like there might be some very nice music. <F>Erm</F> they have a large selection of wine that <R>the wai</R> the waiter pushes around on a cart. And there are only three tables in this picture, and they look like they're really far apart. So maybe it helps people to have their own space and not have to listen to other people's conversations. <nvs>laughter</nvs> There's also a velvet rope that <F>er</F> seems to be blocking one of the entrances. And it almost looks like <SC>the entrance</SC> <R>there's</R> there's no door, like it goes straight outside. So maybe this is a very warm place <R>to</R> to have a restaurant. <F>Erm</F> I think <R>the</R> the woman needs her glass filled because her glass is empty while the man's glass <SC>is</SC> <laughter>still got some wine in it</laughter>. But she's probably struggling to decide which kind of wine she wants. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> the tables are really nice. They have nice white table clothes on them. And it doesn't look like this couple in the front of the picture has the food yet. So they must just be stopping by for drinks or maybe they wanted to start with wine.</B>
<A>O K. O K. Thank you very much, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Er</F> I guess <R>you</R> you found a <F>er</F> favorite restaurant, I don't know about around here, but in Tokyo somewhere.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>Can you tell me about that restaurant?</A>
<B><nvs>cough</nvs> <F>Erm</F> yes. <OL>In Shibuya</OL>,</B>
<A><OL><?>Or one of the place</?></OL>?</A>
<B>there is a place where <F>erm</F> I like to get sushi where most of the plates are a hundred yen each. And you sit down, and it all goes around on a conveyer belt. And you have to eat at least seven hundred yen worth. But I usually eat much more than that. It's really, really good sushi, and it's really fast, and it's really cheap. And I really enjoy Shibuya. It's just because <R>it's</R> it's like a young fun place. <CO>So</CO>. There's tons of people there. And where I come from, we don't have cities that are that big. <H pn="others4">XXX08</H> is nowhere near the size of Tokyo. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>I see. What about the atmosphere? I mean, <R>you</R> you mentioned that it seems to be very spacious. I guess this place is pretty <?>good</?>. <R>Wha</R> what are the people like compared <R>to</R> to this kind of atmosphere?</A>
<B><F>Well</F></B>
<A>How's it feel like in this <OL>restaurant</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL> <F>well</F> the people are definitely not dressed up in formal attire. The cooks wear aprons, and <F>eh</F> they're always busy making sushi, constantly putting the sushi together and putting it on plates and then putting the plates on the conveyer belt. <SC>While the people</SC> there's a time limit so the people are more focused on <F>erm</F> you know, stuffing their faces with sushi than actually having conversations with the people next to them. Plus, you're not at a table. You're at a bar that's around the conveyer belt. So it's really hard to have a conversation while you eat this <laughter>food here</laughter>. <F>Erm</F> <R>it</R> it is very crowded. There's not much room <laughter>to</laughter> move around. And <R>I</R> I think every time I go in there, I end up kicking someone or doing something stupid. <CO>And</CO>. <F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A><R>Ho</R> how did you find this place?</A>
<B>Actually, my friends knew about it. <R>They</R> they took me there. <F>Er</F> I have some friends in Tokyo. And they like eating there because it's cheap and because they like sushi and it's a fun place to go.</B>
<A>O K. Great.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>I have another picture to show you, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>It's a picture of a classroom. And again, I'd like you to describe this in detail for me.</A>
<B><laughter>O K</laughter>.</B>
<A>Thank you.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I never took calculus, but I think that's what the female teacher is teaching. And she looks like she's paying a lot of attention to the board while there's only one student in the classroom who is actually paying attention to her. <F>Erm</F> there are some girls talking in the back. One of the boys in the back is drinking pop while he listens to his headphones. <F>Er</F> one of the girls is playing with her cellular phone. And another really macho-looking guy is blowing a bubble with his gum while he sits and looks cool next to the window. I think he is looking out the window. Maybe there is something interesting out there. But <F>erm</F> it doesn't really look like an American-style classroom. I'm guessing it's Japan. But <SC>I don't</SC> I haven't been in a lot of Japanese classrooms. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> there are a lot of windows. And <R>it</R> like, it looks like when you go out the door, you go straight outside, which is very different from any school I've been to. <F>Erm</F> the students, despite the fact that they are not working on homework or listening, most of them, they all have books out in front of them. Except for one of the girls who's talking in the back who's got a bunch of makeup. She must be painting her nails. And <.></.> they look young, but they almost look like college-age students. And they are all wearing <.></.> normal clothes. They're not wearing <F>er</F> uniform. They're all dressed very differently.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, you mentioned that you didn't think it was America. <F>Um</F> in what ways is this classroom different from classrooms that you <F>er</F> were in when you were <SC>a student</SC> <?>yeah</?>, a high school student?</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. <F>Well</F> <SC>the</SC> <.></.> it looks like the teacher is raised up on a little platform here. And what else? <..></..> I guess the differences are that different. There are little hooks on the desks here that I've never seen before. And the cellular phone she is using is very Japanese looking because in America, those are really expensive and very rare.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> So I guess it could be either. But <SC>it</SC> it's not much like a classroom I've ever done in.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> <R>what was</R> what was the atmosphere in your classroom like when you were <OL>younger</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Erm</F></OL> <F>well</F> when I was in high school, and this is <H pn="others3">XXX07</H>, so it's very cold. But we would never have a classroom where if you step out the door of the classroom, you are outside. It's always <.></.> an indoor hallway. And you have to find an entrance or an exit for the building. <F>Erm</F> the classrooms, they seem a lot bigger than the one in the picture. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> the desks <R>us</R> usually didn't have room <R>to</R> <.></.> to put anything into. They were just desks that were attached to a chair. And <F>erm</F> <nvs>tsk</nvs> I don't know, the kids usually paid attention except for a few in the back. <nvs>sniff</nvs> <laughter>And</laughter> we didn't have to wear uniforms to school because it was a public school. So I don't know how else it was different.</B>
<A>Yeah. O K. That much.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Thank you. Thank you.</A>

<A>O K. Hello? <F>Er</F> this is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H> here. Good morning.</A>
<B>Hey, <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>, this is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. I'm sorry. I'm up in <F>erm</F> Room four-ten. I was just wondering, you know, I have this broken window in my room, and I was wondering if I can get it fixed <F>er</F> as soon as possible.</B>
<A><F>Er</F> <SC>the</SC> <SC?>fo</SC?> the window is broken?</A>
<B>Yeah, yeah, yeah. <F>Erm</F> it's got <R>a</R> a big chunk missing <laughter>out of it</laughter>. <R>It</R> it seems that <F>erm</F> you know, one of our neighborhood kid's probably threw a ball at it or maybe a rock or something. I don't know how it broke. But <SC>it</SC> it's broken, and it's letting a draft in, and I don't want any birds in my room or anything like that. So is there any way you could come up here and fix it today?</B>
<A><F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> I don't know about today. Maybe <F>well</F> Wednesday, Thursday?</A>
<B><F>Ooh</F>. <.></.> <F>Wow</F>. <F>Erm</F> that's really late. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <R>I</R> I don't know. <SC?>It</SC?> there's absolutely no time you can come up today?</B>

<B><F>Oh</F> O K. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I was watching that, too. <R>But</R> but <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I got a kind of cold because <SC>the</SC> there's a hole in my window. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Um</F> you know, <F>er</F> <R>I'm</R> I'm actually recording the game right now.

<A>You miss American sports? <F>Mm</F>?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> a little bit in the fall. <R>I</R> I'm not a really big sports fan, but I did enjoy going to <F>er</F> my college football games and just hanging out with everyone and seeing everyone get excited when our team was winning and getting mad when our team was losing. I think <SC>it's more</SC> it's less about the sport, more about just <F>er</F> coming together as like a school.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>er</F> yeah, <R>I miss</R> I miss going to the football games.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> I have never been to a football <OL>game in my life</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>As you can imagine as a American football game.</A>
<B><OL>Right</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL> <SC>can you explain to me</SC> <F>um</F> <R>you</R> you talked about <R>the</R> the atmosphere <OL>of the team</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>Can you explain to me <SC>how that can affect people</SC> how it affects people?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>um</F>.</B>
<A>It's not the game, it's the atmosphere.</A>
<B>Yeah. <SC>The</SC> our school is very large. I think there is about sixty thousand students in the <H pn="school name2">XXX09</H>.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>And so when we have football games there in the Metro Dome, it's kind of like the Tokyo Dome, it's about that size, and we don't fill up the whole place, but there's a lot of people that attend, a lot of people that are students and also people who aren't students. And <F>er</F> people get very passionate about the game and <SC>about</SC> you know, <R>if</R> if they think the coach is doing something wrong, they'll be yelling <R>at</R> at the coach. <laughter>And</laughter> <F>erm</F> there's usually a little souvenirs that are given out to people <F>um</F> to wave around and to help cheer on the team. It's very, very loud. And there's usually a lot of people drinking beer and eating nachos. And <F>um</F> most of the people wear <H pn="school name2">XXX09</H> colors and shirts. And some people wear hats. And <F>er</F> the mascot which is <R>a</R> a gopher, <F>erm</F> <R>he</R> he <laughter>runs around</laughter>, <nvs>laughter</nvs> and gets people all excited. And then whenever we <F>er</F> score a touchdown or make any points, <R>he</R> he does as many push-ups as we have points. And people get really excited about that. And then sometimes <R>they</R> they take a cannon, and <R>they</R> they shoot like <F>erm</F> shirts,</B>
<A>Ahm.</A>
<B>different <??></??> paraphernalia, I <laughter>guess</laughter>, into the crowd and people really enjoy that.</B>
<A>It's a real show-biz</A>

<A>O K. I'd like to do another role-play <OL>with you</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A>This one's about shopping. If you can read that for me.</A>
<B><.></.> <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K? <F>Uhm</F> this one is face-to-face <??></??>.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. Good afternoon, sir. Can I help you?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Erm</F> you know, <R>I</R> I just purchased <F>er</F> this shirt. And basically, I bought this shirt because I thought it was gonna go with <F>er</F> these pants that I already own. Because the colors looked like they would go together. But <R>it</R> it turns out that they totally clash. You know, it's really, really bad together. And you know, I just bought it, you know, maybe five hours ago. And I brought it home, and now I'm back because <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I'd like to exchange it. <CO>I</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <SC>you</SC> <F>er</F> basically, so we have a policy against exchanges as you know.</A>
<B>O K. What is that?</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> that's just a store policy. <SC>It's written</SC> it was written <R>on the</R> on the door.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I mean, it still has all the tags on it except for the security tag that they took off. So you could easily just put it back on that shelf if you wanted to.</B>
<A><OL><F>Well</F></OL></A>
<B><OL>Is that</OL> a possibility?</B>
<A>yeah, <R>it's</R> it's possible, I guess. But <F>er</F> I mean <R>the</R> the colors don't change in five hours. You knew the color when you bought it.</A>
<B>Right, right, right. Yeah, I understand that. But <R>I</R> I think <R>I</R> I really didn't realize the exact color of the pants and <R>how</R> how they would look together because they do look really bad. And <F>eh</F> I mean I see other stuff in this store that I really would like to exchange for. So it wouldn't be like you are <SC>m</SC> losing money.</B>
<A>You could change the pants. I mean</A>
<B><OL><F>Oh</F> that's true</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>does it have to be that pair</OL>?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> really like these pants. And pants are much more expensive than shirts. So</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>I'd really prefer to exchange it for something else in this store because, you know, <R>I</R> I know exactly what I want. And <F>er</F> <SC>it's actually</SC> <R>it's</R> it's more expensive. So I think it would help you guys more <R>if I</R> if I were able to exchange and just pay the difference.</B>
<A><F>Er</F> give us a little paper work though.</A>
<B><.></.> <OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>You'd have to</OL> deduct the original and then <OL>add this</OL> all again.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>

<A><OL>O K</OL>. What kind of things have you bought so far</A>
<B><OL><F>Erm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>in Japan</OL> <OL>since you've been here</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> I bought clothes. Once it started getting colder, I didn't bring enough <OL>long-sleeve shirts</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>. <F>Uh-huh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So I've been shopping around for clothes. And although I'm in Japan, I've only been really shopping at the Gap, because they have these sale racks where the prices just fall so quickly. And they sell stuff for so cheap, and I really needed sweaters. So I bought like three sweaters and pair of pants, few other things.</B>
<A><SC>How do you decide, generally speaking</SC> not only in Japan, generally speaking, how do you decide when you buy something?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A>What factors?</A>
<B>I think <.></.> the first is, "Do I like it? Does it look good?" <F>Erm</F> "Will it go with the other clothes I own?" <F>Um</F> the next is, "Can I afford it?" And "Is it a good deal, or could I find the same thing for less somewhere else?" And so, so far in Japan, I've been able to find <SC>really good <F>um</F> sales</SC> really good deals here.</B>
<A>How do you find the service compare to your stores?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> the service seems to be much more formal, much more polite. <R>It's</R> it's hard to say if the service is better because my Japanese isn't good enough for people to really help me out. But it seems like <.></.> you know, <R>you don't</R> you don't get the <R>complaining</R> complaining employees like you would in the States.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>So people seem to be much nicer and much more ready to help.</B>
<A><R>Can you</R> can you give me <R>an</R> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> an example of one of those complaining employee from your experience?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <F>wow</F>.</B>
<A>Too many to think about, I guess. But</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><R>wa</R></OL> one that sticks out.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> it really depends on the stores you go to. But <SC>if you go to a store</SC> generally, the stores with the best prices have the worst service. And so <F>erm</F> maybe not clothing. But like if you go to McDonald's, people are horrible, <SC>like they don't</SC> you can just tell that they don't wanna be there and they don't really wanna help you. And, you know, they may call you, "Sir," but <R>they</R> they kind of mumble. If you don't understand them the first time, they get really mad. While here, <F>um</F> you know, I walk into McDonald's, and <SC>they're</SC> they talk to me very formally and they're always smiling. And even though <laughter><?>like</?> I don't understand</laughter> what they say sometimes, they always help me out. It's very nice. <R>I</R> I enjoy the service here a lot.</B>

<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K? Going from one to six. Make up a story. But this happened before. So I want to start your story, "One day last week", and then go.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K?</A>
<B>So one day last week, <R>I was</R> <F>er</F> I was on my way to school, and I just got to the station. And I mean, you know how the station is in the <R>mo</R> morning. It's so crowded. People are everywhere. And <F>er</F> I got a really nice spot right up by <F>erm</F> <R>the</R> the front of <R>the <R>plat</R> plat</R> <F>er</F> the platform so that I'll be able to get on the train and perhaps even get a seat. But <F>er</F> as there was this guy next to me who was talking and he was waving his arms around, his arm bumped into me, and I dropped my briefcase under the train tracks. And so I turned around to this guy. I was like, "What are you thinking? Like look at <F>uh</F> how crowded it is. <?>Would you</?> get off waving your arms around like that?". And <SC>he's l</SC> you know, he apologize and he is looking down at <R>the</R> the briefcase and he was like, "<F>Oh</F> I'm so sorry.". But <F>erm</F> just then, you know, you hear, "<JP>Mamonaku yonban-senni</JP>," you know, and this train comes by. It totally just ran over <laughter>my briefcase</laughter>, and <R>I w</R> I was freaking out. And <R>I</R> I couldn't get on my train. <R>And</R> and so I just waited there. And when it left, the train had just passed over my briefcase, like it hadn't destroyed it. I hadn't ran it over really. It just glided over it. And so I was really, really relieved. And <F>erm</F> luckily, <R>we</R> we got a hold of <F>um</F> one of the workers at the station there, and <R>he</R> he got down on the tracks and he grabbed my briefcase and gave it back to me. And I was able to go to work. And actually made it <F>er</F> on time even though I missed my first train. So, exciting day.</B>

<B><laughter><F>Oh</F></laughter>.</B>
<A>so far?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> the funniest thing on a train.</B>
<A>Or most interesting, most curious.</A>
<B>I think just seeing people pile into your train, like not caring how crowded it is. <R>They</R> they all get on, and everyone is squished together. I think that the first time I saw that, I was really amazed. And then one time, I was coming back from Tokyo one night. And <F>er</F> you know, <SC>all</SC> there were all these people coming back from the bars and all these company workers. And it was really, really packed. And then after some of the people got off, somebody actually threw up on the train. And I didn't even noticed that. I just saw someone bend over. And then later on, more people cleared up. I saw this big pile on the ground where no one was <laughter>standing</laughter>. It was so gross. But I think that's one of the most peculiar things I've seen on the train so far.</B>

<B>O K. So <F>um</F> one day last week, <R>my</R> my two friends, <F>er</F> Michiko and Keiko decided that they were <SC>g</SC> both gonna go on a camping trip. And so they grabbed all their camping gear, and they piled it into their car. And <F>um</F> they made their way out to some camp grounds over by Mount Fuji. And <nvs>cough</nvs> <R>they</R> <F>er</F> they started getting everything ready. They built a fire, started cooking food for the night, <F>erm</F> started putting up the tent, and really getting ready <R>to</R> to stay there for a while. And all the sudden, it started raining. And <F>er</F> unfortunately, they hadn't watched <R>the</R> <R>the weather</R> <F>ur</F> <F>er</F> the weather station to see <.></.> what was going on with it. But <F>er</F> they ended up being a really bad <F>um</F> typhoon and a thunderstorm. All their stuff got blown away in the high winds. And <R>they just</R> they just went in their car. <R>They wer</R> they were so afraid that they were gonna get struck by a lightning or something. <R>They</R> they drove all the way to <F>erm</F> this hotel called <R>Ho</R> Hotel Cosmos about a half an hour away. <laughter>They ended up staying there</laughter> in the mountains, in a hotel instead of camping outside for <R>their</R> <F>er</F> their weekend vacation.</B>

<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. <F>Erm</F> <F>well</F>.</B>
<A>Could be camping or in the lodges or something.</A>
<B>Yeah. <R>I</R> <SC>I went up to</SC> there is a city in northern <H pn="others3">XXX07</H> right by a <H pn="others5">XXX10</H>. And <F>er</F> there's a city called <H pn="others6">XXX11</H>. <R>It's</R> it's a pretty big city, but <R>it's</R> it's kind of old. And <F>er</F> passed <H pn="others6">XXX11</H> is <F>er</F> place called <H pn="others7">XXX12</H>. And I stayed in a lodge there right on <H pn="others5">XXX10</H>. And it is a really enormous lake. I took a lot of walks around the rocks there. <SC>I got to</SC> <F>ur</F> just enjoy the scenery that you don't get when you are living in the city.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So it was really nice. The weather was very nice. <R>It was</R> <F>er</F> it was spring, but the spring in <H pn="others3">XXX07</H> is a lot like the <SC>wind</SC> winter in Tokyo. So it's pretty cold.</B>
<A>What did you actually do beyond</A>
<B><OL><F>Erm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>taking walks</OL>?</A>
<B>I guess <R>I</R> I didn't really do that much in the great outdoors. It <laughter>was mostly</laughter> <F>erm</F> kind of a small-town atmosphere. You know, go to the local <F>er</F> bar, go to the local restaurants. And <F>er</F> I went to <F>er</F> a microbrewery and got to taste some of the local beer there. <F>Um</F> this place called <H pn="others7">XXX12</H> Brewing Company. <SC>They have <R>a</R> a very, very good stout</SC> they have a good red beer and a special ale that I really like. <F>Erm</F> <nvs>tsk</nvs> what else? <F>Oh</F> <F>eh</F> I went skiing because <R>there</R> there are some hills up there. And <R>it was</R> it was still pretty cold out. So I got to go skiing in the hills there.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <R>Apart from</R> apart from Japan,</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>have you been abroad at all?</A>
<B>Not really. I've been to Canada a few times, <OL>but</OL></B>
<A><OL>Doesn't</OL> count.</A>
<B>Yeah. That <OL>doesn't count</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> </A>
<B>Because they speak English.</B>
<A>So this is your first time? <OL><?>Really</?></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>This is</OL>. <F>Ur</F> I've been to Japan once before, but this is the only place <OL>I've been</OL>.</A>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. <SC>What was</SC> when you first came to Japan, <F>er</F> what was your impression?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> my impression was <.></.> I think I was really expecting it to be even more different <OL>than it was</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>At</OL> least at face value, I just saw a lot of the Western influence. And I saw a lot of <F>erm</F> like English words everywhere. And, yeah, I'm studying Japanese back in school. And so <R>I</R> I found it kind of disappointing that <R>I</R> I couldn't <laughter>practice <F>um</F></laughter> all the signs because they all had translations on them. But I think that was my first impression of, say Narita Airport and Tokyo which is, I mean there is a large Western influence as opposed to, if you go to the more <F>erm</F> traditional place as Kyoto and <R>other</R> other places where it's not all city and there aren't a lot of foreigners. It's more traditional. But I think also just the size of everything, things tend to be a lot smaller and</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>very expensive. <CO><R>And</R> and yet</CO>.</B>
<A>Except Gap.</A>
<B>Yeah, except the Gap.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>The Gap</OL> is cheap and electronics are cheap. I can't believe how cheap cell phones are here. The kind of cell phone I own right now <.></.> would cost upwards of three or four hundred dollars in the States while it cost me about three thousand yen here.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>And <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I can't believe it.</B>
<A><?>Right</?>. <F>Erm</F> <R>you m</R> you mentioned that you <SC>use</SC> pick Japanese as your major. I'm interested <R>why</R> why did you pick Japanese as your major?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <R>I</R> I didn't really know what I wanted to do after school. <SC>And so I figured, whatever I decided to do</SC> <SC>if</SC> <SC>I really</SC> I love languages and I'm studying Spanish as well.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>ur</F> I figured whatever I decided to do would help to make me more marketable <F>er</F> if I were to do business or actually be an interpreter. And plus, <R>I could</R> I could change, and <R>I could</R> <F>um</F> I could make it more of a sociology focus, and do ethnography in another country, and be able to live with people. <F>Eh</F> <R>I </R> I felt like it left me with a lot of options. And plus, it's really the only <laughter>thing I</laughter> wanted to study when I got into college. And I've kind of changed my mind since I've studied more of the general classes, because in the States, <SC>we have to take</SC> we still have to take science classes and things at a liberal art school. And <SC>I really</SC> I wish I would have studied more science. I wish <R>I</R> I could venture more into economics and <F>eh</F> you get a minor in that. But <F>er</F> <SC>it</SC> really, <F>er</F> <SC>I just</SC> I love language, I love being able to communicate with people.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <?>Yeah</?>. Except <?>the</?> sushi shop where there's no time for</A>
