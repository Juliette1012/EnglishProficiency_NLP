<A>O K. So my name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>.</A>
<B><JP>Hai</JP>. Nice to <OL>meet you</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Nice to</OL> meet you. <F>Mm-hm</F>. And for the record, <OL>can</OL> I have your name?</A>
<B><OL><F>Um</F></OL> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>Hi, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
<B>Hi. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> O K. So <F>urm</F> where're you from?</A>
<B>I'm from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> <F>mm</F> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>A suburb actually, it's <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. So it's <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. So what are you doing here?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I'm just studying abroad for four months, basically studying Japanese language and the culture.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Um</F> what do you find interesting about</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>.</B>
<A>the language?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> just because it was <F>ur</F> just so different from <F>uh</F> English, like with the <JP>kanji</JP> characters and just language structure. And I'd actually taken <F>ur</F> French and Spanish in high school.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And it was <F>ur</F> a lot different from both of those two. So I wanted something kind of new and different to take. And it's a good challenge.</B>
<A>I see. So other than studying the language, what do you do here?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> take other classes also. And <F>ur</F> we've field placements every Wednesday. We go to <F>ur</F> like a Japanese organizational place</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and kind of like interact. I work at <F>erm</F> an N G O <F>erm</F> in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> <JP>Ichome</JP>, I go there every Wednesday.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. What are your <F>um</F> responsibilities there?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> right now, I'm kind of just <F>ur</F> helping them reorganize different <F>urm</F> like informational pamphlets.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And kind of just copying those from the web site, and <F>urm</F> like reformatting it in kind of <??></??> language. And we organize like their mailing system. So I have just been doing that every Wednesday.</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> can you tell me more about that office?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> yeah. <SC>It's</SC> actually it's called <SC><H pn="others5">XXX07</H></SC> <F>uh</F> <??></??> I'm sorry, <laughter>not <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> <??></??></laughter> <F>urm</F> yeah, <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> and <SC>they have</SC> <F>ur</F> that's where the Japan committee is. <F>Urm</F> it's actually a pretty small office right now. And I think it stays that way because there's <F>urm</F> the main office in Geneva, and they have different branches all over the world. <F>Urm</F> they aid different like works with <F>um</F> like movements against discrimination. Like in Japan and also all over the world, <F>erm</F> a lot of <?>staff that deals</?> with <R>mi</R> migrant workers like they're going to other countries, and discriminated against and treated badly.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I like it. It's very interesting.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. So in the States, <F>urm</F> what do you study?</A>
<B>International studies.</B>
<A><laughter><F>Uh-huh</F></laughter>.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>And what does that mean?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> basically just how different countries interact with one another. And kind of <F>urm</F> how like one country's actions effect other countries and stuff like that. <F>Mm</F>. And my minor is, actually doing a double minor in history and women's studies. So <SC>I kind of</SC> I think all kind of go together</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><laughter>a little bit</laughter>.</B>
<A>Right. O K. <F>Urm</F> what are your plans for after graduation?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I'm not quite sure. I might go to grad school or <F>urm</F> I might work in an N G O. I kind of chose to do one here because I thought I might like that kind of informational experience to seek something I like, or travel. <nvs>laughter</nvs> But I think I'd probably have to like make more money before I go travel.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> I <OL>see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>So, so far, what do you like about Japan?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> everyone's really nice. They are a lot nicer than they are in the States. And <F>urm</F> just kind of like getting used to the whole different experience and everything. <F>Um</F> just the whole atmosphere is completely different. And I really like that a lot. And learning the language's really neat, interesting. So I like that.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> can you tell me about a Japanese friend that</A>
<B><nvs>tut</nvs> <OL><F>Urm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><?>you've met like</?></OL> so far?</A>
<B>We had <F>ur</F> E-pals before we came that wrote to us at home. And <F>um</F> mine's just been really nice. <SC>She</SC> almost of the E-pals were here like the first week we came, and mine was here everyday. And <F>urm</F> it's made you a lot more comfortable. And except she's really nice. We gone to karaoke</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>which I've liked a lot. And <SC>she work</SC> she actually works at Disneyland on the weekends, and waitresses during the week. So she's really busy, but <F>urm</F> she went to <F>ur</F> Disneyland with us because <??></??> of us went. And that was really fun,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>I think she's come to</SC> I live in a dorm and she's come there a couple of times to see a <??></??>.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. What's fun about karaoke?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> just watching different people and how they sing and kind of get really into singing the songs.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>That's what I like to do.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>I like to watch</OL> it when they sing.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>After a while, I get comfortable and sing. But</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>watching, yeah, people's facial expressions <OL>and how they sing</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>I like that. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <OL>Yeah</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><??></??></OL>.</B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. <F>Um</F> now, I'm going to show you a picture.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. If you can describe what you see.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Urm</F> I see a man who looks to me pointing at watches <R>in</R> in a electrical store, and a store clerk kind of showing him where to go and what to look at. <F>Urm</F> there's a bunch of different kind of electrical appliances. Like <F>ur</F> regular cameras, video <SC>c</SC> recorders, television, stereo equipment, and a large entertainment unit, telephones. And it's three o'clock. <F>Urm</F> <.></.> <SC?>But I</SC?> the customer looks a little confused. <F>Urm</F> and there's also a fax machine. And <R>the employee</R> the employee just looks very happy to see him there. <nvs>sigh</nvs> That's about it. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. <.></.> <F>Mm</F>. So you said you live in a dorm.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>O K. So you probably didn't have to buy these</A>
<B>No. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>appliances</OL>.</A>
<B><F>Mm-um</F>.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>Kind of all there.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. What is it like, your dorm room?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> it's actually <SC>I</SC> a lot larger than I thought it would be. Because everyone, before I come to Japan, said it would probably be really small. <F>Urm</F> but it's actually probably the same size or bigger than the ones at my university at home. And actually I've like a cabinet and a chest of drawers, and shelves, my bed and the desk and sink and the mirror. <F>Er</F> the sink and the mirror are next to one another.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. And I like it. Actually, it's a lot bigger than I thought, and comfortable. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><laughter>Yeah</laughter>. Have you had any problems while you are at the dorm?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> right now, my heat. It is kind of a problem because I think the remote control on the <F>ur</F> heat and air conditioning unit is broken, like I tried changing the batteries, and it doesn't work. <F>Um</F> so I can't get the heat to turn <laughter>on</laughter>. That's starting to get pretty cold. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>But other than that, I haven't had any problems. I have to ask my dorm manager about that this evening.</B>
<A><F>Uh</F> O K.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
</followup>
<task>
<A>All right. <F>Hm</F>. So next, another picture.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewer is taking out a picture.</ctxt>
<B>Just describe what <OL>I see</OL>?</B>
<A><OL><F>Mm-hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> it looks like a ski lodge, because of all the skiers and the ski lifts, in winter. And it looks like the children are having a snowball fight. And someone made a snowman right in front of the snow pail. So looks like it's about to <SC>be s</SC> <?>fall</?> down. <F>Urm</F> and it also looks to be a lot of different issues going out with the skiers. One <SC>is falling</SC> has fallen over and has his ski off, and his ski pole has gone flying. And another one looks like she's going in <SC>a</SC> the wrong direction. She's going to hit two other skiers. And none of them have their goggles on. I don't know much about skiing, but I thought you're supposed to wear goggles to protect your eyes, except for the guy who's falling down, he's goggles on. And there's a snowboarder in a background who looks like he's going to hit the man who <SC>fall down</SC> fell down. And there're two people in the cabin having coffee or hot chocolate to keep nice and warm in the cold. And there's a director guy who looks like he's trying to tell the girl that she's going the wrong way. But she doesn't look like she's paying much attention.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. O K.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So you're from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>Do you like the weather there?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> sometimes. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Uh</F> it can get really, really windy and cold in the winter.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And that <SC>'s</SC> all feels a lot colder because of the wind, and it really is. And I say I don't like driving in the weather like that.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>ur</F> like fall and spring, it's actually really beautiful there. And I like those seasons a lot <laughter>better than</laughter> winter or summer because summer can get pretty humid. Not as humid as it is in here. <nvs>laughter</nvs> But fairly humid.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. So how do you spend your time in the winter then?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> sometimes we all go out in snow, and like build snowmen and then snowball fights. It's pretty flat in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> so we can't go skiing, and I've never been skiing. But other times we'll just, you know, do indoor activities or go to the movies or go shopping and try to keep warm. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

<A><OL><F>Ur</F></OL> this one.</A>

<A>This one is about sixty thousand yen.</A>
<B>Does it take good digital pictures?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> of course.</A>
<B>So I can upload them on my computer without any trouble, and all my friends come look at it?</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Urm</F> let's see, I'm not <?>sure</?>. <F>Urm</F> I'd like to <SC>get this one</SC></B>
<A>Yeah?</A>
<B>purchase this one. <F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>

<B><F>Oh</F> five thousand yen more. <nvs>tut</nvs> Does it have a warranty?</B>
<A>Sure. <OL><??></??></OL></A>
<B><OL>How much</OL> is the warranty?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F></A>

<A><OL>Of course</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Of course</OL>? O K. I'll get <laughter>this <?>new</?></laughter> one</B>

<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> That's the end of the role-play.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. So you want a digital camera?</A>
<B>Yeah. I'll get one. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>?</A>
<B><F>Uh</F> <F>urm</F> a lot of people here have them, and they seem really convenient. Except <F>urm</F> I do like having like photos that <?>pronoun</?> like the hard photos</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>which you don't usually get good quality ones with the digital cameras.</B>
<A>Right. So</A>
<B><OL><CO>So I'd have one</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>how</R></OL> how is it different, the quality of the pictures?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> you can put them on the computer and print them out. But they look like <R>kin</R> kind of fuzzy, the ones I've seen because my sister actually has one, and <SC>it's</SC> you can tell it's a digital photo instead of another one. But <SC>you can get</SC> <F>urm</F> <SC>when we were in Kyu</SC> we were in Kyushu in October, and <R>the</R> the host family I stayed with had a digital one, and they have really good digital cameras. But you have to buy like a little photo <?>center</?> to get really good pictures like that. So I think that's the only drawback. That and they're very expensive <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>as opposed to normal cameras.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. O K. So <F>um</F> have you gone <F>ur</F> shopping at a store like the one in the picture?</A>
<B>No. <OL><F>Ur</F> <F>well</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Electrical</OL> store?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I got a camera actually before I came here. It's not digital though. Just because I wanted to have the <F>urm</F> actual copy of the photos. <F>Urm</F> and I got one at a store at home, and just went looking around at different things, and got a small cute one <laughter>that I liked</laughter>.</B>

<B><F>Er</F> it was a long time ago. Like I was <F>urm</F> like ten or twelve.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. Can you tell me about that trip?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> we were actually visiting friends of ours who lived in Florida whose grandparents lived in New York. So we went to New York to see them. <F>Urm</F> we were actually only in the city for a couple of hours that day, and I know we saw the Twin Towers when we were there. Now that I think about it, I remember that.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> and we saw the Empire State Building from the car. But our parents were really concerned that it was very dangerous so we had to stay in the car at all times. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Because they were afraid that something's gonna happen. <F>Urm</F> that was pretty much it from New York that I remember. I'd like to go back though, and go see plays on Broadway and stuff like that. And we were outside New York, <F>urm</F> like in a suburb, we went <F>ur</F> a lake nearby, and it was actually very beautiful. There weren't a lot people there. And there was <F>um</F> a waterfall. It was really small that we went to, you know, it was like <F>uh</F> upstate New York. It was fun.</B>
<A>You mentioned Broadway.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A>What do you like about musical?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I just like the performance and <SC>this</SC> most of the songs. <F>Urm</F> I'm not like <F>uh</F> that familiar with musicals, but just to go and see some, I think. Because I hear a lot of different songs. <SC?>But the one</SC?> my <F>er</F> mother likes some different musicals. So I hear some music. So I'd like to go just to see them.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>My aunt and uncle actually go to New York a lot to see plays on Broadway.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>

<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And the shoes are really high. And probably more expensive than they are in the States. <F>Um</F> and <SC>they don't have</SC> all the things that is interesting is like the malls, the shopping centers and malls in America, they are really like spread out and usually about two floors. But here, everything was up which I thought was interesting, it's because of like the space and everything. That was interesting. Yeah. A lot more crowded. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

<A>Now, <F>ur</F> I'm going to show you some pictures.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>. Let's see.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is selecting a card.</ctxt>
<A>Since you like to go shopping,</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>let's do</OL> this one.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> so the pictures go <OL>this way</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>O K? You can use <F>ur</F> all of them to make up a story, and this happened before.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>So</OL> please start with "One day last week".</A>
<B>O K. <F>Um</F> one day last week, a woman went into a department store to go shopping for a birthday present for her husband. <F>Erm</F> and she was looking at the tie rack, and purchased a green and yellow tie from the man at the store as a birthday gift. She then noticed the shoes on sale, and no one could really <?>blame her because</?> those shoes. And looked at those, and decided that she'd go shopping for herself where she purchased clothing on her fifty percent off. That's a pretty good deal. And left the store with more gifts for herself than for her husband. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. <OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Urm</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> what do you do when you find something that you just can't resist buying, but you know you shouldn't be spending that much money?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I usually think it over a little bit, and then try to talk myself until I need it. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>I sort of "<F>Oh</F>.". I can usually try and justify it depending on the price. If it's <R>too high</R> <F>urm</F> too high of a price, usually <?>I'd have to bet</?>, I probably wouldn't think I need it. But if it's somewhat reasonable, I'd talk myself into getting it most of the time.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. And if it's on sale, it's always better.</B>
<A><F>Uhh</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>I see. <F>Mm</F>. And you mentioned this was a birthday gift. <F>Urm</F> if you remember, can you tell me how you spent your last birthday?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <.></.> I think <SC>I was at school</SC> <?>as today</?> we've classes at school.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And so in the evening, my friends took me out for dinner and desserts <SC>and</SC> at a restaurant. And <F>urm</F> my parents sent me flowers. I got a lot of cards. <F>Urm</F> and we went out for <SC>des</SC> dinner and dessert, and had gifts and everything. And it's during the weekdays so we'd class the next day, and did our homework afterward.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> So that wasn't fun, but that was a good day. Just going out for dinner and stuff like that. Because I was at school.</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>O K. Now, lastly, <F>mm</F> speaking of dinner,</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>once again, if you could make up a story and start with "One day last week".</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures.</ctxt>
<B><F>Ur</F> one day last week, a man and his son decided to go out for dinner to it looks to be an expensive restaurant. And just sat down and had their order taken a good meal with fish and chicken. <F>Urm</F> and discussed many different things about both their lives. <F>Urm</F> and just basically had a nice little dinner, and they were both very hungry, and went separate ways when they were done eating. And that's about it. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Could you tell me about the best restaurant you've ever been to?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> best restaurant I've ever been to. <F>Urm</F> <F>oh-oh</F> <F>ur</F> gone to a lot of different restaurants. I like different things from different <laughter>restaurants</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>.</B>
<A>If you have to choose one.</A>
<B>Choose one. I really like the Cheese Cake Factory at home. It's a chain of restaurants in the States. And they just have <F>um</F> a wide variety</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>on their menu. So if you like Italian, you eat Italian. Or if you like fish, you'd have fish. Or burgers, burgers. So it's probably pretty good for everyone. And then they have really good desserts. <nvs>laughter</nvs> I don't really like cheesecake, but they have really good cheesecake. <F>Urm</F> actually, my friend, my mother, and myself, before I came to Japan, all went out for lunch there. And my friend, for dessert ordered strawberry short cake, and it was probably bigger than her meal.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And <SC>she</SC> <F>well</F> she's really tiny, and my mother and I was surprised. She finished about three-quarter of it. We were impressed <nvs>laughter</nvs> because it was so big. But <F>er</F> they have a good menu. If you're ever in the States, I'd go find one.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. O K.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> when you go out to dinner in the crowd, how do you decide where to go?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> a lot of my friends, we all kind of have the same tastes so that kind of helps. <F>Urm</F> and usually, if not, then majority rules. <SC?>It's</SC?> if someone really hates the restaurant, I doubt we'll go. But <F>urm</F> since we can't share the same taste, it's a little easier if someone <F>oh</F> have a taste for something, we'll go there. Or <F>um</F> <R>at</R> at my school, the <?>Monier</?> has kind of has like a food court so anyone can get any kind of food they like. So that kind of solves any disagreements. But when we decide to go to a restaurant, we pretty much all like the same things so that kind of makes it easier. <F>Mm</F>. And if not, you can always find something that <?>good somewhat</?> like</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>most of the time.</B>
<A>I see.<F>Mm</F>. Do you have any trouble here with the food?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I thought I would have more trouble, but I've tried a lot of things that <F>um</F> <.></.> I wouldn't have tried in the States. I eat now a lot more fish here than I've ever had in my life.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And I think it's because <SC>they ha</SC> <F>urm</F> here <SC>it is</SC> at least to me it seems there's more variety of fish because I don't like what they have at home. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So <SC>I've kind of felt</SC> I thought would <F>ur</F> kind of freak me out before I came. I did. <SC>But it's actually</SC> <?>but O K</?>. <SC>I just</SC> <F>um</F> I kind of miss fruits and vegetables a bit more because <SC>they are</SC> <F>ur</F> like at school or at home, I always have <?>melon</?>. Just because <SC>I'm</SC> like living in the dorm here <SC>that it doesn't</SC> we get one meal for dinner, and then my university in the United States, they've a lot like a large selection of food so we don't get as many fruits and vegetables. But I do buy them <laughter>on occasion</laughter></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>and eat them.</B>

<B><F>Urm</F> yes. <nvs>laughter</nvs> We are doing a community service project on Saturday. <F>Urm</F> at the bay, I think. And then my friend is coming to my dorm, and we're probably gonna watch a D V D <nvs>laughter</nvs> that she hasn't seen.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>Or she has seen, I haven't seen. <F>Um</F> actually tomorrow night, I'm going to a friend's house, <SC>and we're gonna</SC> with some of her e-pals or Japanese friends and then we'll have smoores. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Smoores?</A>
<B>Smoores.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really?</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F>. Because I don't think they knew what smoores are.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. Where are you going to make them?</A>
<B><SC>At</SC> <F>um</F> <SC>she</SC> in her dormitory, <SC>they have</SC> <F>ur</F> she has a kitchen and a stove and everything. So I think <F>well</F> over her stove, we're <laughter>making them</laughter>, but I'm not too <laughter>sure</laughter>. We'll find out tomorrow. And then Sunday, I have a lot of homework, <nvs>tut</nvs> I think. And also do something else <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
