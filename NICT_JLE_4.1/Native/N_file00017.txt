<B><F>Ah</F>. I like Tokyo, I like this area. But <F>er</F> right <laughter>now, I'm</laughter> kind of like I've seen all of it, all I can see. So I'm kind of trying to get out of it, <laughter>a</laughter> little bit to see some more parts of the country.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>But I do like it. <SC>It's quite</SC> it's been an adventure. <OL><nvs>sniff</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. I see. <F>Well</F> so what do you usually do here?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I usually go to Shibuya. <F>Erm</F> but lately the last two weeks, I've been trying to explore, going to Kamakura, Odaiba, <F>er</F> Asakusa. Just as many places as I can around this area, basically. But <F>er</F> I like to generally watch movies here. I hang out with my host family a lot.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B><H pn="others1">XXX02</H> center, homework. <nvs>cough</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. <F>Um</F> please tell me more about your host family.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <SC?>That's abou</SC?> it's four people.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Er</F></OL> the <JP>otosan</JP> is <F>um</F> a Japanese chef at a sushi place. And <F>er</F> my <JP>okasan</JP> <SC>is a</SC> works at a publishing company. <F>Erm</F> then there's <H pn="others2">XXX03</H> <JP>chan</JP> who is a student here at <H pn="school name1">XXX04</H>,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>twenty years old. And <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> <JP>chan</JP> who's eighteen. <F>Erm</F> <F>eh</F> they're a lot of fun. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Yeah. <R>My <JP>ok</JP></R> my <JP>okasan</JP> has big cheeks and this baby face and it's really funny and cute. <laughter>So</laughter> <SC>I hang out with h</SC> I talk to her a lot when she gets back from work. <H pn="others2">XXX03</H> <JP>chan</JP> is usually working a lot in school and stuff, but we talked a lot as well. <F>Er</F> yeah, but it's a lot of fun, actually. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>It's a really good experience.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Do you get together and you go out somewhere sometimes?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> yeah. Usually, <F>er</F> me, <H pn="others2">XXX03</H> and <F>um</F> <F>er</F> <JP><SC>o</SC></JP> <F>mm</F> the <JP>okasan</JP>. <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> <JP>chan</JP> <SC>w</SC> <F>er</F> actually works really late.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Because, I guess, they pay more than other times. So we're kind of a little off-schedule, but we do hang out, like sometimes, a little at the game center and stuff. Yeah. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. <F>Mm</F> O K. So other than hanging out, <OL><F>um</F></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>do you take lessons here <OL><?>for some</?> <??></??></OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. I <F>er</F> <F>ur</F> take Japanese class, about seven credits, <SC>four hours</SC> no, four days a week.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> I do my own personal which I learn on the side or I watch Japanese movies with my host family, and they help me out a little bit <OL>in trying to</OL> understand that.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. <F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But, yeah, I definitely do a lot of <laughter>studying of <OL>Japanese</OL></laughter> here.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <F>Hm</F>. Why are you so interested in Japanese?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> at first, it was really just a curiosity</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>in the language being so different, and <F>er</F> <?>seems so</?> impossible to earn it. But now that I'm here, I'm learning just how important it is to just be bilingual and know other people, languages and you just really have to see like a whole different mindset by learning another language. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So, yeah, <R>th</R> that's why I do it now. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. I see. Is anyone else in your family bilingual?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> yeah. My parents were born in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>, so they speak Creole and French and English, so <nvs>laughter</nvs> they have more of a benefit. <R>I</R> I speak Creole a little bit <R>but my</R> <F>uhh</F> but my French is just not good at all. So I gotta <laughter>learn</laughter>. So after I'm done with Japanese, I'll be studying French and Spanish. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F> busy.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. O K.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Um</F> so back home, what <OL>do your</OL> parents do?</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <SC>My</SC> I only live with my mom,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>but</SC> <F>erm</F> for a parent, <SC>but <F>erm</F> I also live with</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>I</SC> just recently, <SC>I</SC> like <R>I use</R> I used to live with my two cousins for two or three years. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But they just moved out because their parents are still in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>. But my mom works at <F>er</F> <H pn="company name1">XXX07</H>, some marketing company for <R>oil</R> <F>er</F> oil or other big utilities. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>Advertising for those type of things. And <F>erm</F> <R>my</R> <SC>my cousin works at a</SC> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> not works, <SC>she</SC> yeah, <F>mm</F> <F>well</F> I have two cousins, so one of them works at <H pn="company name2">XXX08</H> and the other one is <F>er</F> going to <H pn="school name2">XXX09</H>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>My sister graduated from <H pn="school name2">XXX09</H>, but she lives in <H pn="others5">XXX10</H> now. So <SC>she doesn't</SC> she moved out a long ago.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>So while you are here,</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>what do you miss about home?</A>
<B><nvs>tsk</nvs> <R>I miss</R> <F>er</F> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>I miss <F>er</F> my campus a lot. I miss <SC>my</SC> definitely my family. <F>Er</F> I think some other things that I miss are like just feeling at home.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> feeling at home, a lot of American products I miss, <laughter>actually</laughter>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Um</F> being able to just pick up anything and read is a big problem I have here. Like I can't read a lot of <JP>kanjis</JP> and stuff. So sometimes that makes you feel really awkward. <R?>Like</R?> <F>er</F> like I can't even like read. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>You know.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But, you know, back <?>in America</?> <?>at least</?> <F>mm</F> <?>I can</?> read, you know. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B>So <R>that</R> that's a little bit difficult, because everything's in <JP>kanji</JP> <OL>outside</OL></B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B>and everything. Sometimes you can be like feel lost, you don't know where to <nvs>sneeze</nvs> <OL>go</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Have you been</OL> lost at all?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yeah. First two weeks, I was <R>really</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> really lost. Got lost on the trains here and there.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And <SC>part of that</SC> I guess that was part of the fun <R>a</R> a little bit. <OL><laughter>But</laughter></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>yeah. <F>Er</F>.</B>
<A>So what do you do when you get lost?</A>
<B><F>Ohh</F>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Er</F> it was really bad the first time because <SC>I didn't exactly</SC> <F>erm</F> my host family wasn't around exactly when I <laughter>was lost</laughter>, so it was hard to get in contact with someone. But <F>er</F> I had their card showing an address, or I would ask people around where to go. And they got me in the direction, but I couldn't exactly get home for a little bit. So that was really bad. Or I would just get lost on the train. <F>Er</F> I didn't exactly understand the lines and stuff, so I wouldn't know exactly what line to get on. So it was difficult. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Quite an adventure. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. Now I'm gonna show you some pictures and</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I'd like</OL> you to describe what you see here.</A>
<B>Let's see. I see <F>um</F> some <F>er</F> ski lodge, I guess. <F>Er</F> there're some kids on the left <SC>on</SC> having a snowball fight. <F>Erm</F> there are some people skiing down slope. Someone's actually skiing backwards. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Way on the right, there's someone that's totally stumbled. And <F>erm</F> I forget how to call these things, but there's this little seating thing where you can go up and down the slopes and stuff like that to view the whole ski lodge. <F>Er</F> there're some people having coffee inside a little cabin. Yeah.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Um</F> do you ski at all?</A>
<B>I don't know how. <SC>So <R>I</R> I</SC> no, <R>I</R> I would like to though. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>Yeah. I'd like to. Never been skiing. But I've had snowball fights. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F> I see</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. <F>Um</F> so what other sports do you do?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I played baseball when I was <?>a lot</?> younger. But now I really just work out at the gym. I consider that my sport. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><OL><CO>Wha</CO></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>Occasiona</R></OL> occasionally play baseball <SC>but</SC> <F>erm</F> and basketball, too. But mainly <R>I</R> I like to work out in the gym.</B>
<A>Why is it important for you to work out?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <SC>it</SC> actually it feels good once you get in the rhythm. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>At first, it kind of hurts and stuff, you get sore. But it actually feels good. And when you start seeing results, you kind of wanna stick to it. Yeah. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Er</F> <laughter>O K</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <R>It's</R> it's fun. <R>I</R> I like it. And sometimes you get good notices, so it's cool. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Um</F> have you been able to work out around here?</A>
<B>Yeah. I just started working back out for about three weeks. <F>Er</F> three weeks now at the <H pn="school name1">XXX04</H> gym.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>.</A>
<B>At first, I didn't really know where it was or <R>what it</R> what it had in it. <SC>But</SC> <F>er</F> yeah, so <SC>it's been two months away where I didn't get</SC> going back for about three weeks now. So it's <OL>really good</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Can you tell me</OL> more about that gym?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> it's old. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>There's</SC> <F>um</F> <SC>some of the</SC> <R>there's</R> there's a decent amount of materials to work out with. Very small. But <F>er</F> things are a little bit narrower than in the U S. The bars are <SC>like</SC> really like this. So it's really hard for someone of my size to deal with them.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><SC>But</SC></OL> <F>er</F> and the seats are a little smaller <R>or</R> or shorter. Everything's a space a short in Japan. But <F>erm</F> <R>the</R> the weights are old and stuff. But, you know, you make use of what you got. <nvs>sneeze</nvs></B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Nobody's in there though. It's wired. <OL>So</OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>in case something happens,</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>you know</OL>, nobody's in there to watch you, so I go with a friend. <OL><nvs>sneeze</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL> I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>All right. Next picture. All right?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> O K. This is like a electronic store, something like Best Buy <laughter>or</laughter> <nvs>laughter</nvs> maybe something in Akihabara here</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>in Japan. But <F>er</F> there's a salesman showing a customer some watches, <F>erm</F> it seems like. And <SC>there's</SC> in the store, there's cases <F>er</F> and displays of <F>er</F> cameras, camcorders, televisions, stereos, portable Walkmans and telephones. And it's three o'clock. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><laughter><F>Mh-hmm</F> O K</laughter></OL>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Um</F> you said it looks like the place called Best Buys. I've never been there. <OL>What's it like</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Oh</F> <SC>it's a</SC></OL> in the U S, it's a major</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>er</F> electronic store.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><SC>That's</SC> it's very basic warehouse type of thing. And there're all sorts of audios, speakers, SONY, and all the big <?>brands</?> are there, huge T Vs. Yeah. You get all the standard electronics <OL>you need</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>They're pretty big in the U S.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Actually worked there before. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL> <OL><laughter>really</laughter></OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>All right. <F>Um</F> you said earlier that, you know, in Japan, everything is smaller and <OL>narrower</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Right</OL>.</B>
<A>Other that that, <F>um</F> what differences do you see in like stores here?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>.</B>
<A>Between the States and here.</A>
<B>In stores. <F>Er</F> <nvs>tsk</nvs> <?>yes</?>. <F>Hmm</F> I know, in terms of like electronic <laughter>stores</laughter>,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>there's a lot more like technology and a lot more like selection within the brands <OL>and stuff</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But <SC>I haven</SC> I don't know, I haven't seen so many differences in <F>erm</F> <SC>actual</SC> in stores, actually. There's a lot of nice boutique stores here</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>like they have in the States. Fancy brands and then there's regular stores like Carrefour, which is comparable to Wal-Mart, something like that. But I haven't seen too many differences. But there's a lot more people doing promotions outside</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>and stuff like that, giving tissues and paper saying, "<OL><F>Er</F></OL>."</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>There's a lot more of that. And like they do that a lot more to get you in the store. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.</A>
<B>Like they would all, you know, "<JP>Irashaimase</JP>" loud and everything. Yeah. So <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>they do a lot. Customer service probably would be a little bit better, I'd say, here. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A><CO>It <OL>won't <??></??></OL></CO>.</A>
<B><OL>Depending on</OL> where you go.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>Like no matter where you go, it's like you kind of get some type of good service. Like even if you're like in Mac Donald's, <SC>like the customer</SC> like <F>er</F> the people would be like really welcome you and still be friendly and everything. In America, like people that work in Mac Donald's don't usually wanna be there.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B><laughter>So</laughter> <SC>you</SC> they give you that vibe and stuff. So <R>yo</R> you'll get <R>less</R> lesser service type of thing.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K.</A>

<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>O K. <laughter>Could you tell me</laughter> about that?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> it's big, crowded, <F>erm</F> I think there's a lot to see as well. But <F>er</F> <R>I've</R> I've only been around like Queens and so forth.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And the main city. <F>Er</F>.</B>
<A>So what did you do there?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I have family there. So I would visit them. <nvs>sigh</nvs> But <R>I</R> I'd like <R>t</R> to go to Times Square, <F>erm</F> to visit like Fifth Avenue even though I wouldn't like really buy anything there. But I mainly hung out with my cousins a lot. <SC>They</SC> <F>er</F> when I was young, <SC>I really would</SC> my mom would send me there for like two or three months, <OL>because</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.</A>
<B>I really looked up to them and everything and they were doing good things. <OL>So</OL></B>

<A><OL>Right</OL>. <F>Um</F> how was that different from being with your mom or with cousins?</A>
<B><F>Uh</F> <F>eh</F> <F>er</F>. It was different, because everything that was my mess was usually mine. <CO><laughter>Or</laughter> it's you that</CO>. And sometimes you just need someone to talk to or ask questions or stuff like that. So at times it was hard. And there was just a lot more "on yourself" type of thing. A lot more movie watching, I'd say.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Because I was actually <R>ki</R> kind of sick <SC>at the ti</SC> during the time I was living alone, so I actually had to be home a little bit more to heal up. So, yeah, a lot more <laughter>movie</laughter> watching, I guess. Developing over yourself as well. <nvs>cough</nvs> Yeah.</B>
<A>What kinds of movies do you like?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I like action and I also like dramas. Just maybe something like "Forest Gump" or "Gladiator," <R>those type of</R> those type of movies. <nvs>cough</nvs></B>

<A>O K. So how may I help you?</A>
<B>I'm interested in getting a digital camera.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC?>I'm</SC?> I know there's all sorts of brands and qualities <SC>of</SC> you know, of photos and so forth. I wanted to know if you have any recommendations, and if you could try to <F>mm</F> just explain to me the differences between, <F>erm</F> you know, just in terms of clarity and stuff. And I'd like to spend around four hundred dollars, if possible.</B>
<A>O K. So for four hundred dollars, I think there are two really popular ones.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <F>mm</F> what features do they offer?</B>
<A>Features. <F>Well</F> <F>um</F> one actually can take movie pictures</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>for like fifteen seconds.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Yeah. The other one, clarity is better.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> O K.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>So the other one has a lack of movies?</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>O K. But much better clarity. <F>Well</F> <SC>since I'll probably be using the other one for</SC> <F>er</F> I probably just use one for the pictures. I have a camcorder. It might make sense to get the one with better clarity.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>How much is <F>erm</F> memory cost for something like that?</B>
<A><OL>Pardon me</OL>?</A>
<B><CO><OL>The</OL> <F>er</F> memory cards for the</CO>. <OL><F>Er</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL> O K. <F>Um</F> they are average <F>um</F> <?>maybe</?> <F>mm</F> eighty dollars.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Well</F> I plan to take a lot of pictures. So if you could give me the highest card,</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>that'd be</OL> great.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>So, yeah, I'll take that.</B>
<A>The one with the better <OL>clarity</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Right</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Right</OL>.</B>
<A>O K. So that one is <F>um</F> <??></??> three hundred eighty dollars plus a memory <OL>stick</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>. Actually, <R>is</R> is there a warranty available as well?</B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> O K. <OL>Excellent</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>

<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <R>I</R> <SC>I</SC> before, I was never even a picture person.</B>
<A><F>Huh</F>.</A>
<B>But it's like really convenient to just have it and be able to load it up on your computer. <OL>So</OL></B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B>I like them. And <R>I</R> I don't have to worry about developing them.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I can choose which ones look good and then develop them. <OL>So</OL></B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B><R>it's</R> it's good, actually.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. What got you started?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> just coming here, <R>I</R> I was like, you know, I should get a good camera for <F>er</F> memories and visuals, and I haven't took many pictures really all my life. So <R>it was</R> it was time to start to take pictures and stuff, so I got a digital camera.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And like <R>they're</R> they're very convenient. <SC?>They're <laughter>just</laughter></SC?> <SC>I can see it's like</SC> I can see why I really wouldn't do it before.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>But now with the technology, I'm like "<F>Oh</F>" <R>jus</R> just right there I know how it looks. If it looks bad, I can take another one. I don't have to guess or anything like that. So that's why. <nvs>cough</nvs></B>
<A>I'm not quite sure</A>
<B><OL><?>Sorry</?></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>how it</OL> works.</A>

<A><OL><F>Uh</F></OL> <F>um</F> what do you mean by downloading? Do you know?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC?>once y</SC?> <F>erm</F> each camera, <SC>you pu</SC> there's a memory card.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> it's not film, it's just a, you know, digital file. So each time you take a picture, <SC>it jus</SC> you can see it right on the L C D right there. So, you know, <SC?>i</SC?> once you do that, you can usually just connect your camera up to your computer,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>and the pictures just load onto your computer. <SC>And</SC> <F>er</F> but some other one, you can just take your card out and put in the computer. <SC>But you can just</SC> <F>er</F> from there, you could either <?>blend</?> those on to a C D or give them a memory card and they can print out pictures right there.</B>
