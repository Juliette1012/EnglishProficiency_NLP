<A>Can I have your name?</A>
<B>Sure. My name my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>.</B>
<A>O K. Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>?</A>
<B>Sure. Please do. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>All right</OL>. How are you today?</A>
<B>I'm good, thank you. How are you?</B>
<A>I'm pretty good.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>So where are you from?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> originally, from <H pn="others1">XXX02</H> in <H pn="others2">XXX03</H>. <F>Erm</F> but I attend university in <H pn="others3">XXX04</H>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><H pn="others4">XXX05</H>, <H pn="others3">XXX04</H>. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> O K.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>All right. So how long have you been living in <H pn="others5">XXX06</H>?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> I got here towards the end of August. So almost <F>er</F> in my third month <OL>now</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. Do you like living here?</A>
<B>I do. I do like <H pn="others5">XXX06</H> a lot. <R>It's</R> <F>er</F> it's interesting for a lot of reasons. Yeah. It's very intense in a lot of situations. So there's a lot of people, the hustle and the bustle, <F>erm</F> <SC>it's</SC> gets tiring sometimes. But <R>it's</R> <R>it's</R> it's been a good experience for sure. I've enjoyed that. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>What do you like most about living in <H pn="others5">XXX06</H>?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> just the various things that one can do. Whether you wanna go out or you wanna go to museums or go to <F>erm</F> shows or temples or there's just a lot of things to do. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>Temples? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><R>Temples</R></OL> temples.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> what is so interesting about temples? <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I think for Westerners, <SC>it's just</SC> <F>erm</F> <F>well</F> it's something new. It's something different. <F>Er</F> that <F>er</F> certainly in <H pn="others3">XXX04</H> and <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>, there are not a whole lot of <F>er</F> Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples. So <F>er</F> it's fun to look around those and learn about those religions. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>O K. All right. And your family is living in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> my family is somewhat spread up around the country. My parents still live in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>. My <F>erm</F> eldest sister has just moved back to <H pn="others1">XXX02</H> and <R>has</R> has started a business. And <F>er</F> my middle sister <F>erm</F> has moved <R>t</R> <F>er</F> to <H pn="others6">XXX07</H>, <H pn="others7">XXX08</H> now, and is in law school. So sort of spread up. And then cousins and uncles live mostly in the <H pn="others8">XXX09</H> in <H pn="others3">XXX04</H>, which is one of the reasons why I decided to go to school there. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>. O K.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>So</OL> <H pn="others3">XXX04</H> and <H pn="others1">XXX02</H> and <H pn="others5">XXX06</H>, which is your favorite place?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> that's a tough question. I like them all for different reasons. <F>Erm</F> when I graduate school this May, I will probably <F>er</F> move back to <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But if I can find a job in <H pn="others5">XXX06</H>, <R>I might</R> <F>er</F> I might come back here, too. So</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>we'll see</OL>. Yeah.</B>
<A>All right.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>So what do you study in school?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <R>I</R> I'm a political science major. So <SC>I study</SC> my concentration is <SC>women in politics</SC> <F>er</F> women in American politics specifically. But this semester, I'm studying <F>er</F> Japanese women in politics <SC>so</SC> which is very interesting.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <SC>my internship</SC> <SC>we have</SC> part of the <H pn="others9">XXX10</H> program is a field placement. And my internship is with <F>erm</F> <SC>a member of <JP><H pn="others10">XXX11</H></JP> which</SC> <F>er</F> a female member of <JP><H pn="others10">XXX11</H></JP> which is pretty cool. I'm learning a lot. So it's gone well.</B>
<A>I see. <laughter>O K</laughter>. All right, <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>, do you have any hobbies?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I do, yeah. <SC>I</SC> yeah, <SC>I used to</SC> <laughter>it's funny</laughter>, I used to have more hobbies when I had more free time. <F>Er</F> I played soccer for my first two years of college. <F>Erm</F> so I would say sports in general are one of my hobbies. <F>Erm</F> outdoor activities as well. Hiking, camping, <F>erm</F> in the States, I do a lot of fishing. <F>Erm</F> so sports and outdoor activities, perhaps.</B>
<A>Are you <R>also</R> also interested in Japanese soccer, J-League?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <SC>I</SC> you know, I don't know much about the J-League. I'm actually going to a game. <F>Erm</F> a friend of mine who does her internship at <H pn="company name1">XXX12</H> has got some tickets. And so we're gonna go to a J-League game which I'm looking forward to. I see it on T V <F>er</F> once in a while but <F>er</F> I've never caught on to <F>er</F> watching it. Busy with studying. <CO>So</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Oh</F> you mean in <H pn="others5">XXX06</H>? <OL>You're busy with studies</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>Yeah, yeah</laughter></OL>. Very busy. Very busy. <F>Er</F> we're studying in internship and I also am teaching English class on Friday afternoons, <F>erm</F> <R>a</R> a conversation class. So that's also <R>a</R> a little bit time consuming. But <R>it's</R> <R>it's</R> it's fun. I like being busy. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. What do you enjoy most about teaching English?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <R>I</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> I enjoy being able to be on the other side of the situation. I've studied foreign languages for a while, and I've never had the experience of teaching a foreign language. And I think it's very beneficial for both my learning and for my teaching style to be able to sit on the other side of that and see what kind of strategies work <F>er</F> in teaching English and <F>erm</F> how students understand it. <SC?>It's</SC?> my class is a adult conversation class. So I have <F>erm</F> six people and just focusing on conversation. I do a little bit of grammar <F>erm</F> but mostly just conversation stuff. So it's been good to see how people learn English, because <SC>I think it makes</SC> it helps me figure out, maybe, how I can be better at learning Japanese. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>But it's hard. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>It's real</R></OL> it's really hard.</B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>All right. So first thing today, please look at this picture. <OL><F>Oops</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A>And please describe this picture for me.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> O K. I see a girl, probably a student in <SC>her</SC> <F>erm</F> I would assume, a dorm room. She <SC>is</SC> <F>er</F> has a dog and a cat. A pretty small room. <F>Erm</F> has a large stereo system, a phone, a lot of books. <F>Erm</F> the dog and the cat are both sleeping. She seems to be working at her computer, possibly presenting something. <F>Erm</F> it looks as though she's talking or she's facing her two animals, but they don't really seem to be paying attention to her. <F>Erm</F> the door is open. <F>Er</F> there's a calendar, a clock on the wall. <F>Um</F> most resembling a dorm room to me.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. So <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>,</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>er</F></OL> have you ever had a pet?</A>
<B>Have I ever had a pet?</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Yes, I've had a pet.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. What kind of animal did have?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <SC>we had</SC> we've always had dogs when I was growing up. We had <F>erm</F> a golden retriever when I was a baby. And most of my young life, we had a black Lab. <F>Erm</F> and she actually passed away last year. So</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>that was sad. But <F>erm</F> I've never had one of my own, but I'm <R>looking forward to</R> <F>er</F> looking forward to getting one in a couple of years <?>here</?> when I settle down.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>Again Labrador or golden retriever?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> that's a good question.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Possibly a new breed. <SC>Possibly a different</SC> <F>erm</F> my home stay family has a boxer right now, <SC>which is really</SC> which is a very interesting breed. But <F>erm</F> a little challenging at times. So I <R>might</R> <F>er</F> might go back to the Lab. So</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>we'll</OL> see.</B>
<A>Could you tell me more about the boxer? What's so challenging about keeping it?</A>
<B>Sure. <F>Erm</F> the boxer <R>i</R> <F>mm</F> is a <R>big</R> big breed. <R>And</R> and in a Japanese house, it's, I think, hard for the dog and for the owners to have a <SC>big</SC> large dog. <F>Erm</F> a lot of the day, the dog has to stay in its cage because everybody is away at school or working. <F>Erm</F> and I think there're some space constraints. <CO>So the dog gets very hyper when it is let out of its cage, <F>er</F> and <F>er</F> runs around and knocks things over and</CO>. He's very cute. But <F>er</F> seems to be a <R>little</R> <F>er</F> little out of control sometimes. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><laughter>I see</laughter></OL>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter><CO>So</CO></laughter>.</B>
</followup>
<task>
<A>O K. Another picture.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. Please describe it <?>for</?> me.</A>
<B>O K. I see a house <F>erm</F> in, <F>ur</F> looks to me, a suburban community. <F>Erm</F> there's people walking their dogs. Children playing. <F>Er</F> there's a car parked out in front of the house. <F>Erm</F> it looks to be a nice neighborhood. Probably far away from the city, given the space <F>er</F> and trees between the houses. <F>Er</F> people are reading, jogging as I said. <F>Erm</F> let's see. Probably middle class, not a huge house but big enough. <F>Erm</F> definitely a single family home. People are chatting. <.></.> Yeah.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. So could you tell me about the area where you <SC>li</SC> <F>er</F> used to live in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Sure. <F>Er</F> I lived in the city, so my <F>erm</F> experience was very urban. <SC>I lived</SC> <F>er</F> unlike this picture, I lived <F>er</F> in a house <SC>that was right next to another house</SC> which was right next to another house. <F>Erm</F> I <F>erm</F> had a very urban upbringing, I would say. <R>Took the</R> took the public transportation everyday from, maybe, fourth grade on. <F>Erm</F> let's see. <F>Er</F> just city kid <OL>versus a</OL> <SC>suburb</SC> I would call this suburban.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A>I believe there are many slopes in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>.</A>
<B>Many hills, indeed. Yeah. I lived <F>erm</F> on a slight hill, but close to, <F>er</F> we call the part of town that's <R>on a</R> on a bay, it's called the <H pn="others11">XXX13</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <SC>I live</SC> <F>erm</F> up the hill, there's maybe four or five blocks to go up, and I lived on the other side of the hill. So <F>erm</F> <R>there are</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> there are a lot of hills in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H> unlike <H pn="others5">XXX06</H>. <H pn="others5">XXX06</H> is very flat.</B>

<A>All right. So in summer, what do you usually do? What do <OL>you enjoy most</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Er</F></OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>What I'd</OL> like to do is <SC>what I</SC> <F>well</F> it's different from what I actually <R?>do</R?> do. <F>Erm</F> when I was a kid, I used to go to camps and go on vacation with the family. But towards the end of high school and certainly in college, <F>erm</F> I usually work. I've always worked. <F>Erm</F> last summer, I did research with the professor at my college and <F>erm</F> lived in <H pn="others3">XXX04</H>. <F>Er</F> in my free time during the summer, I went camping, took some road trips with my friends. <F>Erm</F> <F>er</F> let's see. <R>Did</R> did a lot of stuff. Hang out with my family a little bit. My cousin's in the area. <F>Erm</F> <SC>I also pain</SC> I helped my cousin paint his house which was <R>a</R> a pretty big task.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> but usually working. I would say <F>ur</F> summers are usually time for work. <F>Er</F> the previous summer, I lived in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>. And I interned for a <F>er</F> consulting company. So I was working <F>erm</F> forty hours a week there. And I also worked at a restaurant <OL>two nights</OL> a week.</B>
<A><OL><F>Wow</F></OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>That was really busy. But it was to save money. <F>Erm</F> so <R>actu</R> actually that summer, I didn't just work. I went to Europe for three weeks.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So that's why I worked so much on the first part of the summer, so I could go travel.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Where</OL> in Europe did you go?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <SC>we</SC> <SC>a friend and I went to</SC> <F>erm</F> we went all over. <SC>We flew in</SC> I flew into London. We met in London and went to Prague. <F>Er</F> from Prague, we went to <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> Vienna, we went to <F>er</F> Rome, and Milan, and then we went to Brussels <?>on our own</?>.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>So yeah, we were busy. It was a lot of fun.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>It was a lot of fun</OL>, I tell you. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And then I went back to school in the fall.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><SC>So</SC></OL> and that wasn't <laughter>so much fun</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>

<A>So lastly, <F>well</F> O K. This is a picture sequence.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And there are</OL> four pictures from one to four. And please make up a story based on these four pictures.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Er</F> Cindy and Al had a date. They went to the zoo. They met in front of the zoo. And they saw many different kinds of animals. First, they saw the lions. And then they visited <F>er</F> the monkey cages. In the meantime, <F>er</F> <laughter>Cindy</laughter> bought an ice cream cone. And <F>er</F> <SC>they had a g</SC> they had a really good time. They spent about two hours at the zoo. And then they <F>er</F> left and said good-bye to each other.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And had a really good time.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Er</F> have you been to the zoo <nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>in</laughter> Japan?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I haven't, <OL>unfortunately, been to the zoo yet in Japan</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I have been many times in the United States. But I haven't been yet in Japan.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I'd like to go.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>I haven't been to Disneyland either, though. So <OL><SC?>I ge</SC?></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Ohh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><R>I have to</R> I have to do that, too. <F>Er</F>.</B>
<A>O K. Did you go to Disneyland in Los Angeles or Florida?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <SC>I went</SC> let's see, I've actually been to both when I was a kid. I went to the one in Los Angeles once, and then <SC>I went to</SC> we were in Florida visiting my grandparents and we went to <F>erm</F> Epcot Center for a day, which is part of Disney World, as they say. <SC>So</SC> but I haven't been in Tokyo yet. So <R>I'd like to</R> I'd like to go soon. But it's expensive, isn't it? It's very expensive. Yeah. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. And what is the most popular thing to do for a date in the United States for especially college students?</A>
<B><F>Ahh</F>. That's a tough question. <F>Erm</F> most popular for college students would probably be go to a restaurant or go to a movie <F>erm</F> or go out, maybe, for drinks, for beers and maybe some food. <F>Erm</F> let's see. First dates, <R>I usually</R> <F>er</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> I usually go out to dinner.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Go out to dinner and then maybe for drinks afterwards. <CO>So</CO>. Yeah. I don't know about the zoo. <R>I don't</R> <OL><nvs>laugher</nvs> <laughter>I don't think many people go on a first date to the zoo</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter>Right</laughter>.</A>

<task>
<A>O K. <F>Er</F> there is another picture.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. Please make up a story based on these pictures.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> O K. Looks like three people or three friends have decided to go to a movie together. <F>Erm</F> they bought their tickets for the one o'clock show. They went into the theater, bought some popcorn and candy and sodas. <F>Erm</F> they went into the movie. It was a violent movie. There was planes crashing. <F>Erm</F> probably a sad movie, I would assume, if there was planes crashing. <F>Erm</F> <F>er</F> it looks like <SC>as they're en</SC> leaving the theater, they really enjoyed it. They thought it was a great movie. <F>Erm</F> I don't really understand why. But maybe it was <laughter>very entertaining</laughter> or maybe it was a good story. <SC>Maybe everyone has survived</SC> probably everyone has survived the plane crash and that's why they were so happy when they <F>er</F> leave. But they enjoyed the movie nonetheless.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>, <F>er</F> what kind of movies do you like?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I'm not much of a moviegoer myself. But <F>erm</F> <R>I</R> I like various kinds. I'm a big fan of action movies. <F>Erm</F> or I used to be, I guess. My taste is sort of evolving, <F>er</F> I would say. <F>Erm</F> <SC>comedies</SC> I enjoy comedies, some dramas lately, I think there has been some really good movies. <R>But</R> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> but <SC>I</SC> honestly, I haven't seen a movie yet in Japan, and I can't remember the <R>last</R> last movie I saw in the United States. Really. <F>Erm</F> I actually enjoy renting movies more than going to them. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>So what are some advantage of renting a movie instead of going to movie theater?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> <F>well</F> obviously, it's cheaper and that's why I usually do it. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> <SC>I think too</SC> <F>erm</F> I like reading the reviews and seeing, and hearing from my friends and people that I know if they enjoyed it. And if they enjoyed it, then I'd go out and rent it rather than just listen to all the hype and then go to see a movie at the theater. <F>Erm</F> and plus you can watch it, you know, in convenience. You can watch it twice if you want. You can stay up late. You can watch it in the afternoon. You're not set by anybody else's schedule. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>And you can stay at home. <nvs>laughter</nvs> You don't have to go out, <SC>if you</SC> I mean which is nice sometimes.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>Who is your favorite actor or actress?</A>
<B><F>Wow</F>. That's a tough question, too. I don't know if I have a favorite. <F>Er</F> <.></.> I really love Julia Roberts for a numerous reasons. I think she's a great actress. <F>Erm</F> I love <SC>some of</SC> a lot of her movies, in fact. So I would say Julia Roberts at this point.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. What's so attractive about her?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> she is very attractive.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And I also just think she's a really talented actress. I think she picks really good roles.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> in her interviews, she's very down to earth. And <F>erm</F> <SC>she i</SC> I think she is one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood, but is still very <F>er</F> down to earth and rational, and seems like someone that I would enjoy talking with. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <.></.> <OL>yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>So</OL> <F>er</F> what's your favorite movie of Julia Roberts'?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> probably "Pretty Woman". Because <F>erm</F> it's just the first one that pops into my mind. I think she played a really good role. I also liked Richard Gere in that movie. I thought he was good. <F>Er</F> so, yeah, "Pretty Woman".</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>An old movie but a good one.</B>

I've two more this afternoon. <F>Er</F> I have my politics class and then tonight, I have my international business communication class. So just <laughter>basically</laughter> sitting in class today.

<B>It is good practice. <R>I've</R> <F>er</F> <SC>I've learned</SC> <F>er</F> don't tell any of my teachers this, but I've learned more <F>er</F> Japanese from my host family than I <laughter>learn in my Japanese</laughter> class, I think. <F>Er</F> <F>em</F> so yeah,</B>
