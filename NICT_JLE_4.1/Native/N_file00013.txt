<stage1>
<A>O K. Good morning. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. Can I have your name, please?</A>
<B>My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, nice to meet you today.</A>
<B><OL>Nice to meet you</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>How are you today</OL>?</A>
<B>I'm doing fine.</B>
<A>O K. Have you had a good morning?</A>
<B>Yeah. I had a pretty good morning.</B>
<A><F><?>Hm</?></F>. What did you do?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I went to my Japanese class <F>urm</F> which I didn't understand too much. <nvs>laughter</nvs> and <laughter>But that's all right</laughter>. And then I had a meeting with my professor about some stuff I already did in Japanese class <.></.> earlier on, and he was doing some corrections for us. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Ur</F> do you live near here?</A>
<B>I do. I live about an hour away. <CO><SC>I li</SC> it's</CO>. <F>Er</F>.</B>
<A>That's near?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>It's <R>near for</R></laughter> near for Tokyo, I guess. <SC>It's about</SC> <F>ur</F> it's a fifteen-minute-train-ride, and then twenty minutes' walking to the campus from the train station. And then <SC>from home</SC> from the other train station, it's about twenty minutes. <CO>So it's a good hour commute that <laughter>I do every day</laughter> which is sort of</CO>.</B>
<A><?>Lot of</?> walking. <OL><?>Good for health</?></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah, it's <F>mm</F></OL> <laughter>a lot of</laughter>. My legs are getting stronger. So <laughter>that's all right</laughter>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> <??></??></OL> <R>Whe</R> where is that?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> in <R><H pn="others1">XXX03</H></R> <R><H pn="others1">XXX03</H></R> <F>ur</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City, close to the train station.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> <R><H pn="others1">XXX03</H></R> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City.</A>
<B>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</B>
<A>Right. But <F>ur</F> <R>that's</R> that's a pretty big place, <F>huh</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City.</A>
<B>It's pretty huge. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>What's it</OL> like? I've never been there.</A>
<B><R>It's</R> <F>urm</F> <SC>it's kind of</SC> <F>well</F> I'd say it's kind of nice. But, like, the <SC>I don't really</SC> I'm not really into like big train stations or like big cities. <SC>So</SC> but <F>urm</F> there's <F>er</F> lots of stuff going on there. <SC>It's like a huge</SC> there're like, I think, ten tracks there. And there's like a big bus terminal there. Like, you come outside, and there's a big loop where all the buses are waiting there, like fourteen or fifteen stops. And then all around the place there are these huge <F>ur</F> like department store, you know, like Japanese department stores. <F>Er</F> they're super-tall and have like twenty floors of different things, electronics, something like that. <SC>So <R>it's</R> it's pretty</SC> but it's always full of people, like there're people everywhere. So <R>it's</R> it's fun, though.</B>
<A><OL>How</OL> did you end up in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC>we did</SC> <F>urm</F> I just sort of got assigned there by <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, <?>sort of</?> program. Then sort of like we had to fill out a sheet saying what we wanted or not what we wanted, but, like, what is it? For housing, like, there're all these, all sorts of questions that we had to answer. And then so <SC>we would</SC> <F>ur</F> we would just filled it out, and then they sort of assigned us with a family. And I think the family, first, was more important than the location. And so I got <?>a</?> <R>set</R> set up with a family, and then they happened to live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>They're close to the train station.</B>
<A>Are you getting along well with that family?</A>
<B>I'm getting along great. They actually lived in America for three years. They lived in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>.</A>
<B>They have four kids, which is sort of crazy sometimes. But <F>um</F> they're four, seven, eight and ten. Two girls and two boys. <SC>And <F>ur</F> they</SC> so <SC>the</SC> all the children speak English like fluently. And the father speaks English pretty well. Like, the children actually speak English without an accent at all. Sometimes, though, <R?>they</R?> they have like a Southern like <F>ur</F> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> accent <laughter>which is sort of funny</laughter>. Because I'm from <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> so <R>like I</R> like <R>I</R> I hear Southern <SC>access</SC> accents, but I really don't have too much of a accent myself. Or at least, I think I don't.</B>
<A><OL>No</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I'm sure</OL> to other people,</B>
<A><OL>No, <??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I do, but obviously</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Urm</F> so <R>that's kin</R> that's kind of funny. <SC>It's</SC> also it's <SC>had to</SC> frustrating, though, because I feel like my Japanese is sort of slowed down <OL>by that</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>. I was thinking that. How're you gonna improve your Japanese?</A>
<B>Right. <SC>I mean, like</SC> <SC>so I speak</SC> <SC>it's</SC> actually it's really funny. Like, <SC>I'll talk with <R>my</R> <F>ur</F> My host father</SC> my host father talks to me in English because he wants to practice English, and I talk to the kids with English because they wanna practice English as well. But <F>urm</F> when the host father talks to me in English, I'll respond to him in Japanese. <laughter>And so</laughter> <SC>it's sort of</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> it's funny because he's Japanese, speaking English, and <SC>I'm English, speaking Japa</SC> or I'm American, speaking Japanese. <SC>So it's</SC> and it's kind of funny. But <SC>it's sort o</SC> it's like we both completely understand. It's not like I'm trying to like coerce him into speaking Japanese <SC?>by</SC?> when he talks to me in English, <OL>responding</OL> in Japanese.</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>. Right. Right. Right.</A>
<B>But <F>urm</F> it's just sort of the way it works. It's just kind of funny.</B>
<A>How did you get into Japanese in the first place?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> in high school, <SC>I studied</SC> actually, I did aikido, which is <F>ur</F> you know, it's a <F>ur</F> Japanese martial art. And <SC>I got</SC> <SC>I di</SC> I only did it for about like four or five months in high school, till the end of my senior year. And then I couldn't do it in college, because there wasn't a place close enough to me where I could study. <SC>And then <F>urm</F> I</SC> <SC>but I just started <F>mm</F> sort of thin</SC> <F>well</F> <SC>I get</SC> so I learned more about Japanese that way, sort of <R>li</R> like Japan and Japanese culture and whatnot. <SC>And then <F>urm</F> I</SC> <F>um</F> <F>oh</F> <F>well</F> <R>lots of people</R> lots of people at my school do study abroad. Junior year. And so I knew I wanted to go somewhere, <SC>especially</SC> like, because it's such a good opportunity just to experience like another culture and <SC>another</SC> and live in another place, and also get away from school for a little while. <F>Urm</F> so I started thinking about where I wanted to go. And I thought it'd be really cool to <SC>like go</SC> actually like go to Japan. And originally I just sort of just wanted to go and study aikido, which I thought would be really cool just like live in Japan and <SC>study</SC> like, my sole purpose would be just to study aikido. But <F>urm</F> I realized that without <SC>spe</SC> being able to speak Japanese and all, that probably wouldn't be too feasible. <R>And</R> and <R>I wanna</R> I wanna graduate on time, so I would have had to take a semester off to do that. <F>Um</F> so I ended up last year, my second year in college, <F>ur</F> I took <F>ur</F> Japanese <SC>all</SC> right, for the whole year. <R>And then</R> and then now I'm here. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F>. O K.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>We have <F>ur</F> various tasks for you <R>to</R> to do this morning.</A>
<B><?>Great</?>.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> first of all, I'd like you to look at this picture. It's a picture of a map.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I'd like you to</OL> describe what you can see in detail.</A>
<B>O K. <R>Just</R> <OL>just describe it</OL>?</B>
<A><OL>Just</OL> describe it.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>This is good. This is good. <nvs>laughter</nvs> All right. Yeah. <OL><?>That's all right</?></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Anything, O K</OL>.</A>
<B>All right. <F>Well</F> so there's a train station <SC>in the first</SC> <F>mm</F> sort of in the <SC>upper</SC> I guess, northwest corner, since it's a map. <F>Urm</F> from the train station, there's a big road that's leading, what, sort of <SC>northwest by southeast</SC> no, northeast by southwest. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And <F>ur</F> so <SC>the</SC> close to the train station, there's a river. It's a big river that looks like it gets bigger as it goes towards the east. There is a zoo next to the train station across the road, Route Twenty-four. It's the name of the road, and it's across the road. <F>Urm</F> to the left of the zoo, <SC>there is</SC> there's a bank and then some offices. <F>Urm</F> and then if you keep on going left, there's another road called Station Way. <F>Urm</F> and then across Station Way, <SC>there is <F>ur</F> another</SC> there's a school. And there're some trees there. <F>Urm</F> there's also a public library if you cross Oak Street from the school. And then behind the public library, there's a hospital. <SC>Going</SC> if you were to go, let's see, <F>well</F> from the hospital across Station Way going to the right, there is a restaurant. And then if you kept on going to the right, and you crossed Elm Street, then you'd get to the Park View Apartments. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Urm</F> there's also a supermarket that's across Park Avenue from the apartments. And then to the left of that crossing <SC>stati</SC> back over Station Way is a bookstore and a post office and a bus station. <SC>There's also</SC> <F>whoops</F> there're some movie theaters <SC>behind the parking lot</SC> no <SC>behind the</SC> <laughter>I'm sorry</laughter>, behind the supermarket. And then by the movie theater, there are bunch of houses. And if you keep on going south, <SC>you'd get int</SC> you'd run into Route Forty-four which looks like <F>ur</F> it's a pretty big road. And then to the South River.</B>
<A>O K. <laughter>This is</laughter> the full detail on <OL>that</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>What's your <R>impre</R> impression of this town?</A>
<B>My impression of this town? It looks pretty small. It looks like it's maybe kind of boring. There's not a lot to do. You could either go eat at the restaurant or go to the movie theater. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Looks like <R>there're</R> there're some trees, which is nice, which is good to see, because a lot of towns these days are treeless or filled with super-tall buildings and whatnot. So it's nice to see some nature. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And then the two rivers. <F>Urm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>So <OL>yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. O K. I presume <F>ur</F> back in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>, that there are plenty of trees?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. Yeah. Yeah, there's a fair <OL>amount</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>What</R></OL> where is the hometown?</A>
<B>In <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>, <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="others5">XXX07</H> <OL>I've heard of that</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><CO>I don't know</CO></OL>. Yeah.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>A lot of people have heard of it.</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> what's it like? I mean <R>wha</R> what <OL><?>do people</?> do</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> It's a pretty boring town. <SC>It's actually</SC> I mean, <SC><H pn="others5">XXX07</H> was one of the first</SC> <F>well</F> <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> was <SC>one of the</SC> in like American history, one of the first colonies established, and <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> is like right next to <H pn="others6">XXX08</H>. <SC>It's</SC> <SC>like I can</SC> if I ride my bike <R>over</R> over <SC>the</SC> <F>ur</F> what's that, the lake, I'm pretty much in <H pn="others6">XXX08</H>. Like I can get there in like ten minutes or so. <F>Urm</F> <SC>but</SC> and then I guess <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> was, what, established like sixteen fifty or something, I'm not sure exactly when. <SC>But</SC> <F>urm</F> and so <SC>there's</SC> I guess maybe about fifty years ago, <SC>there was a big <?>push</?></SC> to <SC>I'm not exa</SC> <R>I</R> I'm not really sure exactly when it started, but <SC>it's</SC> <F>ur</F> basically it's a tourist town. And so, like, <F>ur</F> <SC>people</SC> <F>um</F> there's a big like colonial sector that's sort of kept the same way as it was, you know, like back in sixteen fifty. And so like everybody comes to visit it all the time, and, like, there're always tourists. I mean <R>it's</R> <R>it's</R> it's a tourist town. Like, there're restaurants and hotels and <H pn="others7">XXX09</H>, it's called.</B>
<A><R>For</R> for the people who live in the real <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>,</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><R>how</R> how do they feel about such a thing?</A>
<B>I personally hate it. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Like, I mean, <SC>I think a lot of</SC> I've always thought that <SC>it's not a great</SC> it's a good town to grow up in, like, maybe, like, from being a baby to maybe eleven or twelve. And then <SC>from twelve to</SC> from twelve maybe to thirty, it's just a not-happening town at all. And maybe <SC>like sett</SC> like when you wanna settle down, you know, like <R>it's sort of</R> it's sort of like a settling-down town. It's not at all a happening town, you know. So I personally, like, right now, like, I avoid it <laughter>as much <OL>as possible</OL></laughter></B>
<A><OL><SC?>Not the age</SC?></OL>.</A>
<B>Right. Exactly. <CO>But I <OL>mean</OL></CO>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Urm</F></OL> but <R>how</R> how do the locals interact with all these throngs of tourists?</A>
<B>They interact pretty well, for the most part. Like, people would go about their daily life. Like, I mean, there are actually like a lot of people that are employed by <H pn="others7">XXX09</H>, like, working in the shops, or like dressing up, like do interpreting, you know, like doing all kinds of stuff. <SC>And then</SC> and I guess it brings a fair amount of employment to the town.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>. <nvs>sniff</nvs> There's also, I should mention, in the town, a college, <H pn="school name1">XXX10</H>, which is I guess <F>ur</F> it's a sort of famous school, I guess. But <F>urm</F> at least people in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> <laughter><??></??></laughter>. <SC>But</SC> <F>urm</F> and so a lot of people work there, too. And <F>urm</F> like for the most part, <SC>I guess interaction with tourists is not</SC> <.></.> I mean, <R>I</R>, I guess it's sort of comes in waves, right? So, I mean, like, in the summer, like, there're lots of tourists. And like <?>sometimes</?> people complain about like people not knowing the way around or whatever, you know, like when you're driving. There's this great place called "confusion corner," right next to <H pn="others8">XXX11</H>. <SC?>Li</SC?> <F>er</F> <SC>it's</SC> I mean it's just really confusing. There's like a stop sign and a yield sign. <SC>And</SC> but then <SC>the people coming from</SC> but the people taking a left turn have the right of way. And so <F>mm</F> which is just sort of odd for, you know, an American, so, you know, there's always confusion <SC>about</SC> <R>e</R> especially tourists, you know, will come there and stop and not know what to do and then.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><?><F>Ur</F> it's bad</?>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><??></??>.</A>
<B>Right.</B>
</followup>
<task>
<A>O K. One more picture I'd like to show you. It's a picture of a classroom, actually. I'd like you to describe this in detail.</A>
<B>Great. O K. First, there is a teacher explaining something that's on the board. It looks like some math. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <??></??> I can tell you <SC>what it</SC> what's going on. <F>Urm</F> the teacher is in front of the desk. She's pointing at the blackboard, reading from a book. <F>Urm</F> in the background, there are students. It looks like there are <SC>six</SC>, yeah, <nvs>laughter</nvs> six students. And there are <F>ur</F> various modes of paying attention. I guess that's not very good English, is it? <R>There</R> <SC>there</SC> I've kind of forgotten my <laughter>English</laughter>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>I've been in Japan for too long</laughter>. <F>Urm</F> <SC>I</SC> some people are paying attention, and some people are not. It looks like the boy with <SC>the yellow hair</SC> the blond hair in the front is paying close attention. He's taking notes. There's a girl <SC>to the right of him, or</SC> <F>well</F> to his left who <SC>is</SC> looks like she's E-mailing on her phone. <F>Urm</F> the boy to the right of him who's wearing glasses and looks very muscular <F>urm</F> is chewing bubble gum. He's blowing a bubble. There're two girls behind the bubble blower who are talking, and looks like they're maybe doing make-up or talking about make-up. She's maybe talking about her nails. And then there's a guy behind <R>the</R> the blond-haired boy who is drinking, looks like juice or something, and listening to a Walkman, and has a pencil and paper out like he's taking notes. But it looks like he's not.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. If you were that teacher, how would you <F>urm</F> control that class?</A>
<B>How would I control that class? <nvs>sigh</nvs> I don't know. It's actually interesting, because <R>I</R> I'm doing some teaching here, <SC>like, in the</SC> and I actually just talked with <SC>a Japanese professor</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>not profe</SC> I mean, <F>well</F> a teacher in an elementary school about what she does when people aren't paying attention. And <F>ur</F> she said a lot of times what she'll do is <SC>find somebody</SC> like, for instance, like it's clear that the girls in the back aren't paying attention, so she would call on the girls and then ask a question and then try to get the girls in the class to answer. <F>Urm</F> <SC>which I</SC> I guess that's a pretty good method. It's also funny because I'm a camp counselor, too. Like I've been working at a summer camp for the past like four years. And it's really, like, it's my <R>li</R> like, I love to do it. And like the friends that I've made there are like some of my best friends, you know, ever, and <SC?>s</SC?> I'll probably be working there for a long time. <F>Urm</F> so I'm big into like we call it using <F>er</F> like a counselor voice, like a big sort of loud, like, "Hey, everybody, listen up.". And like <R>clapping</R> clapping your hands <SC?>I di</SC?> <nvs>laughter</nvs> so maybe <SC>I'd probably</SC> I might do some of that, or I might just sort of let it slide and try not to let it stress me out too much that people weren't paying attention, and <SC>sort of</SC> if they aren't paying attention, then that's sort of their deal and I don't wanna stress myself out over trying to make them pay attention.</B>
<A>Sure. Sure. Comparing that situation to your own days in high school, <R>what</R> <R>what</R> what do you think is the biggest difference?</A>
<B>Biggest difference? <F>Well</F> first of all, the cell phone. We wouldn't have a cell phone <nvs>laughter</nvs> in class. <F>Urm</F> <.></.> I guess <F>ur</F> definitely in my high school, people didn't pay attention a lot. But not to this degree. Like <SC>they're</SC> I mean, there would be little small chats in the background when the teacher was talking. <SC>But like</SC> and like people would <R>like</R> like be chewing gum or maybe drinking. But it's much more discreet, I'd say. <SC?>Like it would</SC?> you know, <SC>like you wouldn't</SC> <R>like</R> like the guy who's blowing a bubble is like sort of staring out of the window with his like arms defiantly crossed, like, "I'm not listening to you at all.". Like <nvs>sniff</nvs> people would at least sort of feign like they're paying attention, all right?</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>And like</R></OL> people would like sleep, but, you know, try to like prop one arm up or like, <laughter>you know</laughter>.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>So they wouldn't look like they were asleep. <CO>But it's clear that they were asleep, especially when they started</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> You know, they started <laughter>falling over</laughter>. <OL><??></??></OL></B>
<A><OL>O K, O K, great</OL>. Thank you very much.</A>

<A>O K. Now, I need to do series of role-plays with you.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Scenarios. <F>Ur</F> first of all, look at this one here. <?>It's an invitation</?> card. I need you to read this card, sort of understand the scenario. And then when <R>you</R> you've got it, <R>I'll</R> <F>urm</F> I'll start.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card for a while.</ctxt>
<B>O K. <OL>I think I can</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K, you get the</OL> scenario?</A>
<B><?>I don't know if I can do it</?>. <?>Let me get a better look</?>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K. On the telephone. <OL>Hello</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Hello</OL>.</B>
<A>This is <F>ur</F> <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H> here.</A>
<B>Hey, <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. This is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. How are you doing?</B>
<A><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> Hey, look, I'm really sorry about last night. <R>I</R> <F>urm</F> I just wanna apologize to you for not showing up. <SC>I</SC> actually, I had a crazy night. It was insane. <R>I</R> I was driving along and all of a sudden I got this huge flat tire and the car started spinning out of control, because it's winter and it's really icy on the road. And so we ended up in a ditch, me and my wife. And <F>ur</F> so luckily we were unharmed and we were both wearing seat belts, so we ended up <F>urm</F> not getting hurt. But anyway, we had to like get out of the car, and then as soon as we got out of the car, the car caught on fire. <R>And</R> and then, since <R>we were close to</R> <F>ur</F> we were close to a forest, like, some of the trees <OL>caught on fire, too</OL>.</B>

<B>Yeah. <F>Oh</F> God, <SC>there's no</SC> <F>ur</F> I mean <R>there</R> there's a train that can take, you know, to <F>ur</F> Washington, D C or something. But <R>it's all</R> it's all driving or riding bikes. <SC>It's really not even</SC> I mean, you can walk, but <SC>it's non</SC> <.></.> I mean <R>i</R> it's a long walk, you <OL>know</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>.</A>
<B>Like to get anywhere, <SC>is a</SC> it's a pretty big walk, <OL>I guess</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Have you <SC>had a</SC></OL> ever had any trouble with a car?</A>
<B>Not too much trouble, actually. I've been lucky <SC>with my</SC> I drive a Honda Accord. I love that car. It's actually my mom's car. But I drove it all through high school. And <F>ur</F> <?>there was</?> some like small motor trouble here and there, but for the most part, it was fine. Like didn't have any big trouble.</B>
<A>I know that a lot of <F>um</F> kids do drive to high school.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uhm</F> yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>to and from</OL>. It's <F>er</F> inconceivable in Japan, of course.</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A>But</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A><F>er</F> or even in England, really. But <SC>the</SC> <F>urm</F> that idea strikes me. What happens to the student who doesn't have a car? Maybe they don't have enough money or</A>
<B><OL>Right</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>their parents wont't let them</OL>. <R>How</R> how do students like that feel when <SC>everybody's got</SC> the lot is filled with students' cars,</A>
<B><?>Those</?> <OL>students</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><?>and they</?></OL> don't have one?</A>
<B>Yeah. <SC>The</SC> I mean <.></.> <SC>there's a</SC> <SC>there</SC> <F>well</F> there's a bus, you know, that takes you there <F>urm</F> if you don't have a car. And like, <..></..> you know, <SC>honestly, I've never talked to anybody who didn't</SC> <F>ur</F> it's not that I wouldn't talk to anybody who didn't have a car, but I've never talked to them about, you know, like <F>oh</F> "How do you feel about riding the bus?". <CO>Like</CO>.</B>
<A><SC?>So there were ki</SC?> I mean, <R>i</R> it's not like everybody had a car.</A>
<B>Right. Right. <F>Oh</F> yeah. There're definitely like buses that, yeah, took people. I mean, mostly, by senior year, like <.></.> either, like, you had a friend who drove or you drove yourself, you know, or <SC>the</SC> something like that. So <SC>you di</SC> most seniors didn't ride the bus. <R>Or yo</R> or you live close enough to school that you could just walk there in the morning, or you could <SC>walk</SC> you know, walk to a friend's house or something. <F>Urm</F> but <SC>I</SC> and I guess, like, the thing about riding the bus was sort of like <R>not</R> not a stigma definitely, but <R>like</R> <.></.> like I hated riding the bus. Like <SC>for</SC> most people like hated riding the bus. <SC>Like they really</SC> like it's sort of like it's something that you do if you have to, but like most people hate it. <F>Urm</F> so I guess the people who rode the bus like weren't too thrilled about riding the bus. And maybe like sort of <F>oh</F> not envious, but like <SC>wanted</SC> maybe wanted to drive. <CO>But</CO>. <F>Ur</F>.</B>
<A>That stigma that you mentioned, <R>that's</R> that's an economic thing?</A>
<B>I like <R>not so</R> not so much, I don't think. Like me, personally, I didn't like riding the bus <SC>because</SC> admit that I wasn't independent. You know, <SC>like</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>being able to</SC> I mean, it's sort of <R>like</R> like you ride the bus in elementary school and middle school. I mean, like, you have to. But then like once you get to high school, like, you know, <SC>you</SC> like freshman year, fifteen, like you know what's going on in the world, you know. Like you're growing facial hair or <SC>you're</SC> you know, you've got a girlfriend. <R>Like</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> like you wanna be independent, you know <SC>or</SC> at least, I did. You know, <SC>I</SC> was <?>like that time</?>. I shouldn't speak for everybody. But <F>urm</F> so like definitely riding the bus, like personally, I didn't like it. I definitely didn't stigmatize other people <OL>who rode the bus</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>No, no</OL>.</A>
<B>You know, I wasn't like, "<F>Oh</F> they're a bus rider.". You know, like <F>ur</F> "He's a car driver.". I mean <F>ur</F> I guess I <SC>never really</SC> in my mind, never really made that distinction between like people driving, people riding the bus. You know what I mean? <CO>Like</CO>.</B>

<A>O K. Good morning, sir. <SC>Can I</SC> how can I help you?</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Well</F> I wanted to talk to you about the Florida Keys getaway trip that <F>ur</F> <SC>we</SC> my wife <OL>and I went on</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>It's a wonderful trip</OL>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> actually, <F>er</F> it looked like it was a wonderful trip, but I really have to disagree with you. <F>Urm</F> apparently, the Florida Keys that you were talking about are the different Keys <R>than</R> <F>ur</F> than I know. And <F>ur</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> we actually ended up staying with the Key family in Florida.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <SC>we got</SC> <SC>we</SC> <R>the</R> <R>the</R> <R>the air</R> the airplane trip was fine. We got there <F>urm</F> <R>with</R> <R>without</R> without any <R>trou</R> trouble at all. But <F>ur</F> then we came and <F>ur</F> <SC>the taxi</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>the</R> <R>the</R> the limousine driver was waiting there, like they said. But then <F>ur</F> as soon as we got into the car, it was this old busted-up Chevy and we had to ride in the back. It was a truck, and we had to ride in the back. And then <SC>we went</SC> and we drove <SC>to</SC> down to the <F>ur</F> swamp, and we stayed with the Key family for a week.</B>
<A>Which is part of our <F>um</F> enjoying the <SC>F</SC> cultural heritage of Florida program.</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F>. I see. But I think that there is a little discrepancy in what actually happened and what you <F>ur</F> proposed to happen. For instance, <SC>the pool</SC> the <F>ur</F> luxurious swimming pool that was guaranteed and the hot tub right next to it was actually a swamp and <R>a</R> <F>ur</F> <R>a small</R> a small tub filled with hot water <F>urm</F> which I could barely fit in myself. <F>Urm</F> the Key family was a lovely family. <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I really enjoyed spending time with them. And we invited them back up to <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> maybe. But <F>ur</F> <R>this</R> this was horrible, and <R>I</R> I mean, I think this is just outright lying that you did on your brochure. And I want a full refund. <CO>And I'm very seriously considering calling my lawyer and having him <F>ur</F> talk to <OL>you guys about</OL></CO>.</B>
<A><OL>But we don't</OL> need to go that far, I'm sure, sir.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> you know, <F>ur</F> <SC>could you <F>ur</F> recompensate me</SC> could you pay me back for <F>ur</F> what <?>happened during</?> the trip? <OL><CO>I got a</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ur</F> <F>well</F> <F>urr</F> <F>er</F> it does say</OL> in the brochure, sir, that unfortunately, refunds are not permitted in this program.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Well</F> that's really <OL>interesting</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>We really</OL> don't have any complaints <SC>for</SC> from the Key family.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>People stay with the Key family.</A>

How do you say that in English? <SC>Like</SC> <.></.> all right, <SC>I left <laughter>on</laughter></SC> I feel like my English skills are going down the tubes. I left on, when did we leave, a Sunday. <SC>Friday night, I couldn't sleep</SC> <F>er</F> <F>well</F> Thursday night, I slept maybe like four hours. Friday night, I slept maybe like three hours, four hours. And then Saturday night, I slept like one hour - like, I couldn't sleep at all. But <R>I</R> <SC>I got here</SC> <F>well</F> <R>on the</R> on the plane, <R>I was</R> I was just so excited about it <SC>like</SC> and like nervous and, you know, <SC>and just</SC> all these emotions like just mixing up just like <R>not</R> <SC>not even</SC> making me not being able to sleep. And <F>ur</F> so I got here, and I just had this stupid, like, shit-eating grin on my face. Like <SC>I hadn't slept</SC> <SC>I probably hadn't slept in like</SC> by the time we got to the hotel and I finally went to bed, it was like maybe thirty-six hours, maybe like thirty hours, something like that, without sleeping. <SC>And</SC> <F>ur</F> but like the whole time I got here, like I just had this huge grin on my face, and I was just so excited to be here. <F>Urm</F> I mean, like, that definitely probably wore off, though. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>

<A><F>Urr</F> <F>well</F> <F>ur</F> you're aware, sir, that basically we have a policy against refunds.</A>
<B>Right. I realize that.

I see on the schedule there's a train leaving at twelve o'clock, and it's nine-thirty right now. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> <F>ur</F> you could do that, sir, but <F>ur</F> <SC>it's only</SC> that's nineteen dollars fifty for a ticket. I'm sure</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A>you could manage that.</A>
<B>But <SC>the thing is</SC> I mean, I understand about there're no refunds. <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I think I can accept that.

But I just sort of like, for the most part, tend to laugh it off. <R>Like</R> like <H pn="others12">XXX15</H> Station at eight o'clock in the morning, <SC>like I go to</SC> <R>I</R> <SC>I do</SC> <F>ur</F> <F>urm</F> I work at a elementary school every Wednesday. And it's crazy, and it's it's like teeming with people and, you know, like people are everywhere just like packed around you. And like sometimes if I'm really tired or like not awake enough, like it just sort of like makes me angry, you know, or whatever, just so many people, so much stuff going on. But <F>ur</F> like for the most part, I just sort of like laugh it off, and like it's kind of fun. And sometimes it's kind of fun like just <SC>mo</SC> trying to move around all the people and stuff and <R>like</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> like, you know, when you're both like going to the same direction and like trying to like go around the other person, it's kind of fun. But it's sort of like I have to force myself to kind of get into it. You know, just be like, "All right, no, this can be fun," rather than like, "This sucks.

<B>All right. So one day last week, <nvs>cough</nvs> I was driving in my car, just driving the car like I normally do, going to work. And <F>ur</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <SC>I was taking a turn</SC> I was making a turn. And there was this guy <SC>on a motorcycle</SC> on a scooter, actually. He was on a scooter, and he was all talking on his phone, all dangerously driving the scooter with one hand, chitchatting away. Luckily, he was wearing a helmet, so <R>that was</R> that was nice. <F>Urm</F> but as I was taking a turn, he just completely didn't see me and he <SC>went away</SC> went ahead. And though I had the right of way, I ended up bumping into him. <F>Well</F> he ended up dropping the cell phone that he was talking on, since he was talking on it so dangerously. And it fell and it broke. And this guy had the audacity to ask me to pay for his cell phone. <SC>And as well</SC> no, I'm <laughter>sorry</laughter>. <F>Oh</F> God. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Can I start over? <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> O K. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And this guy got angry at me for running into his car. <F>Well</F> so we called the police, of course. The police ended up coming. And <F>ur</F> I explained to <R>the</R> the police that he was talking on the cell phone and that it was his fault, and that he shouldn't have been talking. <F>Urm</F> and the policeman took down the information. And so, since this was just last week, the court date and stuff is still pending and whatnot. But <F>ur</F> <SC>his car</SC> his motorcycle ended up getting <SC>taken aw</SC> towed away. And <F>ur</F> I drove <F>ur</F> back on my way. And so <R>the court</R> the court date is sometime <F>ur</F> next month.</B>

<B>O K. <laughter>I'll</laughter> look this one <laughter>over more carefully before I</laughter> start. So <nvs>cough</nvs> let's see. One day last week, my two friends <F>ur</F> decided to go camping. And <F>ur</F> they packed up all their stuff. They had all the, you know, the right equipment. I mean <F>mm</F> they had a tent, they had backpacks filled with flashlights and <SC>food or</SC> <R>they</R> <R>they</R> they brought some food with them, and they had cooking stuff and stuff to start a fire. And they had everything. And it was great. And so they went out to the mountains, and they pitched their tent close to a river. And <F>ur</F> they set up the tent <?>great</?> and <R>everything</R> everything was going really great for them. <F>Urm</F> they were cooking some food. But <R>right</R> right before they started to eat, <F>ur</F> it started to rain a little bit. <F>Urm</F> and so they got a little bit worried, but it was O K. <R>It was</R> it was fine. They kept on cooking their dinner, and maybe had about five minutes left <F>urm</F> until it was done, and <SC>their</SC> you know, they had their tent, you know, so everything was gonna be fine. Of course, it rains <R>when you're</R> when you're camping, so it's no big deal. They were prepared, like I said. But then <nvs>cough</nvs> the rain started getting stronger and stronger. So they went into the tent. And <R>they</R> <F>ur</F> they brought the food in and they started eating it. But <F>ur</F> then the wind picked up <SC>and it</SC> and there were gale-force winds. And <F>ur</F> <SC>they had to</SC> the tent actually was blown away by the wind, and <F>ur</F> along with it, all their stuff. And <F>ur</F> so <SC>they had</SC> they ran to the car, and luckily they didn't get hurt <F>urm</F> with all <laughter>the stuff</laughter> blowing away. But, so they got in the car, and they drove. And <SC>it was so bad</SC> <SC>the driving was so bad that <R>they were</R> they were gonna just go back home but</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>the driving was so bad that they went to a</SC> or it's so unsafe to drive all the way back home that they went to the closest hotel, which was a really nice hotel. And <F>ur</F> so they pitched over the money to stay in this really nice hotel. And then they dried off, took showers and had a great view of the mountain.</B>
