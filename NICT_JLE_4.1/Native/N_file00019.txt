<stage1>
<A>Yeah. Let's begin. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A>Can I have your name, please?</A>
<B><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Yeah, sure.</B>
<A>O K. All right. How are you today?</A>
<B>Good.</B>
<A>Good.</A>
<B>Fine, thanks.</B>
<A>All right. So <F>ur</F> how long have you been in Japan?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I've been in Japan for four months. I came August twenty-third.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>So</SC> <F>ur</F> no, three months, and I'll be leaving December twenty-third. So <OL>it'll be</OL> four months.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>. O K.</A>
<B>about that I'll be in Japan.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>How</OL> do you like living here?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> it's fine. The commute is kind of hard because <SC>it's really</SC> <F>well</F> I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> so <SC>it's</SC> I have to take a bus and walk <F>er</F> and take a train also. So it takes a long time. But <F>urm</F> besides the commute, <F>urm</F> <SC>it's kind of</SC> <SC>it's k</SC> <F>ur</F> I guess for me, I adjusted pretty quickly because <F>urm</F> I have a lot of exposure to like Japanese <F>um</F> customs and stuff. So it wasn't like too much of a shock for me. So I didn't really have a problem adjusting. So it's O K. <laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. So why have you been exposed to this kind of culture?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> because my grandmother, <F>well</F> my parents also, they are all from Taiwan. And so my grandmother had Japanese education when she was young. And so she also knows how to speak Japanese. And <F>um</F> like I eat a lot of Japanese food at home because she knows how to cook it, and we go out to restaurants a lot. And <SC>there're</SC> <R>I</R> I live in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, and where I live, there is a lot of <F>um</F> Asians like Chinese, and there is a lot of Japanese people, too. So in that way, like I'm able to be like around</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>like Japanese customs and things a lot.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. O K. And you mentioned commuting is really hard.</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> could you tell me more about the trouble you're having? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>s</SC> <SC>from my house</SC> I live homestay. From my homestay to the train station, it's about a thirty-minute bus ride depending on traffic. Like sometimes it's shorter, but usually it's longer. And then from the train station, I take <SC>twenty minute</SC> <F>ur</F> twenty minutes on the train to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> Station. And then from there, I walk for another twenty minutes. And so I spend like an hour and a half commuting everyday back and forth. So it takes a long time. <R>But</R> but when I go to Tokyo, it's closer, I think. So that's kind of nice because only about twenty, twenty-five minutes away by train. So yeah. But to school, it's kind of <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> hard.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>But you get used to it.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><laughter>O K</laughter>. <CO>And <F>ur</F> are you living with your host family or</CO>?</A>
<B>Yes. I'm living with a host family.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> it's <SC>mo</SC> one mom and <F>ur</F> I have a host sister.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I actually have two, but the older one doesn't live at home. So it's just <F>urm</F> the three of us.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So it's kind of nice. <F>Urm</F> it makes things simple.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Yeah. <OL><??></??></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Please tell me</OL> more about the host sister?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> she's seventeen. She's in high school. <F>Urm</F> let's see. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <CO><F>Ur</F> <SC>she's pretty</SC> <SC>I guess</SC> <F>urr</F> like <R>you</R> you mean like <R>what</R></B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>what</CO>?</B>
<A>What kind of person is she?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> O K.</B>
<A>What do you usually do with her?</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>. <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>I have a</SC> I actually have a <SC>si</SC> real sister who's seventeen. And they actually have the exact same birthday.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Like my</OL> host sister and my real sister have exact same birthday, same year. So that's kind of <F>urm</F> weird. But, yeah, so I guess because we are four years apart, I'm twenty one, so like I have stuff to say to her, but not that much. Because we're still kind of different, I guess. <SC>She's still</SC> but, I think, to me, she's still very much a teenager, and <F>um</F> very much like high school girl kind of, you know. <nvs>sniff</nvs> So but <SC>we go out</SC> I've been out with her a couple of times. Like we went shopping and stuff. But I think it's harder when we talk to her because <F>um</F> like her Japanese is really fast and it's usually <R>ca</R> casual Japanese. So <R>then</R> then it's hard for me to understand sometimes. And then like it's easier a bit for me to talk to my host mom because <R>she</R> <SC>she know</SC> <SC>she tries to speak slow</SC> I think she <SC>tries</SC> probably tries to <R>spea</R> speak slower. And then when she knows that I don't understand, she'll like repeat stuff. But then I think my host sister probably gets <laughter>inpatient <R>if</R> if I don't</laughter> know what she's talking about. So that's kind of harder. But otherwise <SC>she's really</SC> she's nice.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. She's really nice. She's really sweat. <CO>So</CO>. <OL><F>Mm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. O K. All right.</A>

So it's cold.

<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>

<B><F>Urm</F> in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, I live in northern <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> near <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>. And I go to school at <H pn="school name1">XXX07</H> in <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>. And driving, it's six hours, <OL>so <laughter>no</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><SC>I</SC> so at school, <F>urm</F> I live in apartment</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>with my roommate. And so from school, I live about like maybe driving five minutes away from school. But <SC?>I</SC?> parking is really, really hard to get at school so then we usually take the campus shuttle to school which takes about fifteen minutes.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> so it's pretty <F>um</F> convenient. But where I live is really <laughter>expensive</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Like <SC>the</SC> near school, the apartment rent is really expensive. Yeah. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. <F>Ur</F> please tell me about your roommate.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> my roommate is my friend <SC>from high</SC> <F>oh</F> no, <SC>from</SC> I knew her since sixth grade.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. Sixth grade in elementary, <?>so</?> sixth grade. And so I've been friends with her since and went to junior high and high school together. And then we went to college together. And the first year I was at school, I didn't room with her. Because I thought maybe it'd be better to not room with a friend, like room with someone random. <SC>Second year</SC> and this is when we lived in the dorms, and second year, <F>urm</F> we decided to live together in the dorms. And then after the third year, we moved out into apartments. And then so we lived together. <SC>Then</SC> and then the forth year we moved to another apartment, and we live together. So <SC>she's really</SC> I think she's really easy to get along with, easy to live with. Because we're both kind of the same like like to keep things clean and <F>ur</F> we kind of have the same interests like <R>goin</R> going out and stuff. <F>Urm</F> <R>she</R> she is studying <F>um</F> <R>computer science and</R> computer science and engineering. <F>Urm</F> she's tall. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

<B><F>Ur</F> yeah. <F>Urm</F> the city I live in is called <H pn="others6">XXX09</H>. And it's a relatively small city, but <R>it's</R> <F>urm</F> <SC>it's</SC> <SC>I think it's pretty</SC> and then <SC>like the housing or everything is pretty</SC> the land there is pretty expensive. So it's a pretty <F>urm</F> <SC>ex</SC> I guess, expensive city. And <R>there's</R> <F>ur</F> <SC>there's only a few high s</SC> there's a few high schools and elementary schools. And</B>
<A><nvs>cough</nvs></A>
<B><R>it's really</R> it's really small. Like you can get from one side to the other side driving in ten minutes. So it's really small. <F>Urm</F> but it's really convenient because <SC>there's</SC> like you drive anywhere and there's supermarkets and everything. There's a junior college there. <F>Urm</F> what else? The roads are pretty well <laughter>paved</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>urm</F> where I live is more on the edge of the city. And it's more <F>er</F> like <SC>at the bottom of</SC> right before you go up a mountain kind of thing. So it's kind of like up there, out there. <F>Urm</F> what else? <R>I</R> <R>it's pretty</R> it's pretty quiet.</B>

<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> so I think that the reservoir area's sort of place where people can go and relax on weekends. Or <F>mm</F> people go shopping at <R>the</R> the malls. <F>Urm</F> <.></.> <SC>many people</SC> I think people just kind of relax on weekends.

<A>how did you do that?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <SC>we</SC> <F>ur</F> because we were college students, so <SC>we</SC> no one knows how much the rent was. <F>Urm</F> we wanted a two-bedroom apartment, but the area that we were looking at, all two-bedroom apartments started from really high. The rent was too high. So we settled at the one-bedroom apartment. And <R>we actually</R> we actually looked at a lot of the apartments. And <SC>we</SC> as soon as we saw that one, we liked it, because <R>it was</R> it was <F>um</F> newly remodeled. So they repainted the apartment and the carpet was new, and all the appliances and the kitchen were new. So the apartment <SC>was</SC> just looked really new to us.

<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.Yeah. I <R>ha</R> have. But it's <SC>pretty</SC> relatively expensive</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>compared to the United Stat</SC> <F>well</F> yeah, <SC>some of the s</SC> there's really expensive things, and there's also places where we can go where it's less expensive. So <nvs>sniff</nvs> when I go to the really expensive places, I just window-shop.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. But <F>urm</F> yeah, I like the shopping here because there're so much and there's a lot of variety.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>So I always see something new. It's always interesting to go shopping. It's not like in America, there's only like few malls. And it's always the same thing, you know.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>So yeah.</B>
<A>So where is your favorite place to shop?</A>
<B><F>Uh</F> <F>ur</F> here?</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <R>I like</R> I like <F>urm</F> <SC>Okachimachi</SC> <OL><SC>Oka</SC> <F>ur</F> Ueno or something</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>uh-huh</F></OL>. Yeah.</A>
<B>There's <F>uh</F></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>the street where there's a lot of small stores and then there's a <F>uh</F> Abu-Abu, I think, <SC>store</SC> department store.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I like it there because there's a lot of young people stuff. And <SC>it's relatively</SC> it's pretty <F>um</F> good, reasonable <SC>price</SC> prices.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>So I like going there. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Wow</F> interesting. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><laughter>Yeah</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A>So what is the best thing you bought so far?</A>
<B><F>Urrr</F> <F>urm</F> <SC>I bought</SC> <F>well</F> I kind of stay away from the clothes because <SC>I</SC> the clothes here are really small. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>They're really small size for skinny girls. So <F>ur</F> mostly like <F>ur</F> I bought purse which I like a lot. So probably that. But I also buy things that we can't really find in the <SC>S</SC> United States. Like they have really pretty <JP>origami</JP> paper. And like rice paper were really, really pretty. So I bought some stuff like that. And like <F>ur</F> <JP>omiyage</JP> for my friends. <CO><F>Urm</F> <F>oh</F> <SC>I like the</SC> I think I like the makeup a lot more here than in the United</CO>. There's more variety.</B>
<A>Really?</A>
<B>Yeah. Definitely. So yeah. <SC>I</SC> yeah, I can spend forever in those stores <laughter>that sell</laughter> makeup and stuff. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Are there more variety here? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>I think so</OL>. It seems like it. Like there's a lot more different brands.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I mean</OL> I haven't heard of most of them. But they have expensive brands like the departments brands. But they also have like in drug stores and stuff. But <SC>they have</SC> to me, it seems like they have a lot more variety here. Yeah.</B>

<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And</OL> please tell me what's happening.</A>
<B>O K. In one, <SC>they're going to the zoo</SC> <F>urm</F> a guy and a girl are going to the zoo. And they look happy about it. <F>Mhm</F> they get to the zoo, and they're looking at a lion in a cage. And the guy is pointing at it, showing the girl, and he's talking about it. <F>Mhm</F> and then the next <SC>thing</SC> animal they look at is the monkey. The monkey's sitting on the branch, eating a banana. And the girl is eating a frozen yogurt. And they look happy. And the guy is talking. And then they leave the zoo. And the zoo has closed the gate. It's closed. And they say, "Bye.".</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. O K. All right.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So have you been to the zoo in Japan?</A>
<B>No, I haven't. <OL><F>Uh-uhm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>No, <F>mhm</F></OL> O K. <SC>So what is</SC> I think in this story, they're having a date.</A>
<B><F>Uh-hm</F>.</B>
<A>So what is the most typical date for college students in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>?</A>
<B>Probably the most typical would be <F>urm</F> go to movies <SC>and then</SC> or dinner and a movie, <R>is probably</R> is probably the most common especially if it's like the first date or something. You go to nice restaurant to eat dinner and afterwards, you go watch a movie together.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I think it's probably the most typical.</B>
<A>I see. O K. So have you found a nice restaurant in Japan?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> <.></.> <SC>I</SC> <SC>a restaurant that I like would</SC> I like the Italian restaurant in <?>Prena</?> like Capricciosa <OL>or something</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>It's a chain, I think.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But I like it because it's not <SC>really</SC> like a really nice restaurant. It's more casual. But the atmosphere is kind of nice.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I think <SC>that's</SC> that would be a nice place to go.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> do you see any differences between Japanese Italian restaurant and American <laughter>Italian</laughter> restaurant?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> yeah. I think definitely the food. I actually like <SC>the food</SC> the Italian food here better because it's lighter. It's not so rich and creamy. <SC>And like</SC> but <SC>too</SC> not salty. And so the taste is lighter. <F>Urm</F> usually in America, in Italian restaurants, <SC>you order single serve</SC> it's like you order for yourself, whereas at that restaurant in Japan, <F>um</F> you order and you share. But they have restaurants like that in America, too. Just not as common. <F>Urm</F> <F>oh</F> they give you <F>urm</F> coffee or tea afterwards.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Like it comes with the meal. And that never <laughter>happens</laughter> in America. Yeah. <R?>Y</R?> yeah. But then on the other hand, if you order coffee in America, <SC>you get refills</SC> you can get refills for just like the regular coffee, whereas in Japan usually there's no refills or anything. <F>Urm</F> so I guess <SC>that's</SC> those are some of the differences.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> and <F>well</F> where I live in America like <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, you can't smoke <SC>insi</SC> indoors in any restaurants. <R>Any</R> anything, you can't smoke indoors. So that's a big difference. Like here, you can smoke anywhere. So then <R>it's</R> <SC>it's kind of</SC> yeah, that's a big difference.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. What do you think of the people who smoke in the restaurant in Japan?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> I guess it's not really a big problem. But <SC>it's</SC> I think it's kind of hard on people who don't smoke. Because you have to be breathing. Other people smoke while you're eating, and it makes the food taste <laughter>bad</laughter>. So I don't really like it. But <F>urm</F> I mean they have like smoking sections and non-smoking sections. But it doesn't really help because smoking is right next to the non-smoking. There is no divider. So I think it <SC>would</SC> is probably good if <F>urm</F> they went towards not smoking indoors or having like really separated sections.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>

<task>
<A>All right. So the last picture. Can you please look at this picture? There are six pictures this time.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>And please make up a story based on these six pictures. And please start your story with "One day last week".</A>
<B>O K. One day last week, <F>urm</F> a woman looked into her refrigerator and saw that <SC>it was</SC> there was no food. It was completely empty. So she decided to go to the supermarket. So she drove her car to the supermarket, <F>urm</F> and did her grocery shopping. And she bought some cereal, it looks like, and her cart was pretty full. And then she went <R>to the</R> to <SC>the checkout</SC> the cashier <R>to</R> to pay. And so the cashier ran <SC>every</SC> all of her food up, and she paid her money. And she packed it up in bags and packed in her car. And then she went home, and cooked an egg and some soup.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. All right. Thank you.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>

<followup>
<A>Do you sometimes cook here?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> here, not really. <F>Urm</F> I cooked once for my host family. I cooked some spaghetti.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><CO><OL><R>Because</R></OL> because that's like, yeah, <R>I</R> I</CO>. But <F>urm</F> I cook <SC>at ho</SC> <F>urm</F> at school. Because when I live in the apartment, I have to cook by myself. And <SC>it's really</SC> where I live is really expensive to go out to eat all the time.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So yeah, I cook more <SC>of</SC> <F>ur</F> at my apartment <OL>usually</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>So in your</OL> apartment, what kind of things do you cook?</A>
<B>Usually, sort of <F>ur</F> simple. I guess usually <R>s</R> stir-fry. I stir-fry <F>um</F> Chinese food. And pasta's pretty easy, too. So usually that and rice. I have a rice cooker.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So make things as simple as possible.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. So do you cook with your roommate?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <SC>u</SC> <F>well</F> our schedules are <SC>u</SC> different a lot. So usually we don't cook and eat together. Once in a while, we do. But usually not. Usually we just cook for ourselves.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mm-hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>Have you ever had a problem with your roommate?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> <R>not</R> <SC>not especi</SC> <SC>not really</SC> no, not really big problem. Maybe the only thing I can think of would be like her keyboard of her computer is really loud.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>So sometimes</OL> when I'm trying to sleep at night, <SC>you can t</SC> you can really hear her keyboard. And that makes me not able to sleep. But otherwise, no, not really. No problems. I think we live together pretty well.</B>
<A>So what is the secret of keeping a good term with a roommate?</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>. <SC>May</SC> <F>urm</F> <SC>I think <laughter>mo</laughter></SC> I think it's <SC>mainly based on</SC> mainly depends on the people, I guess. Like if you're really like compatible, and if you sort of have the same kind of living habits, that's probably the only way. Because it's hard if you're completely opposite. Like one person's really messy, one person's clean, <R>it's hard to</R> it's hard to <F>um</F> get somewhere in between like compromise. <SC>Usually</SC> so usually I think it has to be between the people. If they <SC>st</SC> already started out being <F>um</F> like pretty easy to live with, like the two of them, pretty compatible, I think that's probably, <laughter>yeah</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>
<A>O K. And you mentioned the area where you live near the campus</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A>is a kind of expensive area.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>But <F>ur</F> is there any good restaurant in the area?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F></B>
<A><nvs>cough</nvs></A>
<B>let's see. Yeah, there are. <F>Urm</F> I'm trying to think of one. <F>Urr</F> there's some Italian restaurants that are pretty nice. And there's also Chinese restaurants, but I haven't been to them. Because I think <SC>they're</SC> they probably wouldn't be that good. And they have this one street near where we live where they have a lot of Japanese restaurants. So they have like a good <JP>ramen</JP> place.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> yeah. <R>Ye</R> <laughter>yeah</laughter>.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>All right. So have you tried Japanese food here?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> yes, I have. Like my host mom cooks Japanese food most of the time. So and I like it a lot. I like all Japanese food like sushi. I eat pretty much everything except for <JP>natto</JP>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Why don't you like it?</A>
<B>I don't know. <SC>I can'</SC> I tried it, and I tried to eat it. But <R>I think it's</R> I think it's probably the smell <R>that I can't</R> that I can't take. Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. What's your favorite Japanese food?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> <.></.> <SC>probably</SC> I like sushi.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. I like sushi a lot. Like raw fish and <SC?>I really</SC?> I like it a lot. It's one of my favorites.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. <F>Ur</F> <SC>is there</SC> is sushi in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> different from Japanese real ones?</A>
<B>Yeah. Actually <F>urm</F> they have sushi in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> that they don't have in Japan <OL>which is really weird</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>Like <H pn="others7">XXX10</H> <SC>is not</SC> it's like a American Japanese food. And <F>urm</F> <F>ur</F> what else? <F>Oh</F> in United States, when they have <R>the</R> the sushi that goes around, they put it on little boats and they float in the water, and it goes around. Yeah. <SC>I didn't</SC> <SC>I thought</SC> I mean I thought it came from Japan, right? But when I asked my host sister, she said they don't have that here because here's only on the conveyor belt.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>And it goes around. And I was like, "What? They don't have it here?" And she's like, "No, I've never heard of that before."</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>So I was really surprised. Yeah. <SC>They have</SC> but they put on boats and it's in like a little thing in water and they float around. It's really cute. But</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>yeah, I didn't know that they don't have it in Japan.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Yeah, it's weird</OL>. It's really weird.</B>
<A>It's fancy.</A>
<B>Yeah. Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I know. And there's one other thing <F>urm</F> I was asking <F>mm</F> one of my Japanese friends if she's ever had <JP>mirugai</JP> before. And she said she's never heard of it. I don't know if you've heard of it before. <SC>It's like</SC> I was really surprised because it's pretty expensive sushi in the United States. They have it in the restaurant. And it's <??></??>? I don't really <??></??>. It's like a big clam kind of thing.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> it's like a big clam, and then you eat it raw. So it's like a piece of that on top of rice.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
