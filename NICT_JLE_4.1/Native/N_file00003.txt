<B><OL>Yeah, O K</OL>.</B>
<A>What's it like around here?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> it's <.></.> typical <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>, you know, suburb of Tokyo. <F>Er</F> three quarters of this city is built on reclaimed land. <F>Erm</F> that's how they became <R>a</R> a city. <F>Er</F> it was reclaimed land and putting people there. <F>Erm</F> it's on <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> <JP>sen</JP> <SC>which is <F>uh</F> very typical</SC> <F>er</F> it's actually a subway line. Runs out <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> and to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. A very typical pack-them-in in-the-morning subway line where I'm going in the other direction. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>So it's pretty empty for you.</A>
<B>Yeah, it's pretty empty for me. <R>I</R> I always have a seat. <F>Erm</F> and I watch people, you know, getting pushed into the train on the other side <OL>of the tracks</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter>Good for you</laughter>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Good for you if <?>you don't have</?> a guilty conscious about that.</A>
<B>No. <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I ride it towards the city one day a week. So, yeah, <R>o</R> on Wednesdays, <R>I'm</R> I'm getting, you know, pushed into the train.</B>
<A>O K. Can I ask what do you have to do on Wednesday?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> on Wednesday, I go down to <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> <F>er</F> to do a field placement. <F>Er</F> <R>I</R> I work down at <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> one day a week.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>That's interesting.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>How did you</OL></A>
<B><OL><F>Ah</F> that's</OL></B>
<A><OL>get into that</OL>?</A>
<B><F>er</F> through <H pn="others7">XXX09</H>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> that's part of the program.</B>
<A><R>What</R> what are your responsibilities there?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> essentially none. <F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><R>I</R> <R>I</R> I go <laughter>there</laughter>. <F>Eh</F> I just kind of hag out. <F>Erm</F> go to the meetings, <F>er</F> just watch stuff.</B>
<A>What is there to watch?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> past week, I went to a Foreign Relations <F>er</F> Committee hearing. <F>Er</F> watched that.</B>
<A>It's in Japanese, right?</A>
<B>Yeah, in Japanese. Yeah. <F>Erm</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <SC>I can't</SC> <F>uh</F> <SC?>I</SC?> honestly, I can't understand most of it. <F>Er</F> but <F>ur</F> I <R>unders</R> understand bits and pieces</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>er</F> <R>o</R> of what's going on. <F>Erm</F> and so <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I've got a <R>general</R> general idea <R>o</R> <R>of</R> of what they are talking about.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>Er</F>.</B>
<A>From the schools, <SC>you</SC> <R>what's the</R> what's the point of it?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <R>from</R> from the schools, <SC>you</SC> <R>i</R> it's to see Japanese people in action. <F>Er</F> <SC>it's</SC> <SC>is</SC> <R>i</R> it's part of our class called Social Organization in Japan. <F>Er</F> but essentially, it's just to see Japanese people in real life <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <SC>at</SC> <R>i</R> <R>i</R> in the work place as opposed to in a bar on the weekends.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A>But <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> is a rather unusual work place than I would imagine.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <R>i</R> <R>i</R> <R>i</R> <R>it's</R> it's different. <F>Erm</F> <R>i</R> <R>i</R> <R>it's not</R> it's not a typical business.</B>
<A>Yeah. Can you <F>er</F> talk about as differences as you <?>perceived them</?>?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <F>er</F> <R>i</R> <SC>i</SC> the offices are just <F>er</F> very small. <F>Erm</F> so you don't have the typical, like desks set up.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <R>a</R> <R>a</R> <R>and</R> <R>and th</R> and the boss, you know, <R>the</R> <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> members, more than just bosses, almost a God within the office <R>that</R> that everyone <F>er</F> can avows to. <..></..></B>
<A>Interesting.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><SC>How did you</SC> if I may ask, how did you get involved in this program in the first place?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> just through my university <F>er</F> back on <H pn="school name1">XXX10</H>. <F>Erm</F> <R>I</R> I just signed up, fill out the application, got accepted. <F>Er</F> and here I am.</B>
<A>What's the secret <F>erm</F> recipes of how <??></??> getting accepted?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> being able to pay the tuition.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>
<A>That's about it?</A>
<B>That's about it. Yeah. <SC?>At least</SC?> you have to have <F>er</F> at least a three-point of G P A. <F>Erm</F> and <F>er</F> <R>tha</R> that's essentially on the requirement.</B>
<A><R>No</R> no language requirement?</A>
<B>No language requirement.</B>
<A>How have you managed to pick up Japanese?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I've</SC> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I'm constantly amazed at how much my Japanese actually helps me. <F>Erm</F> because <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I didn't know <R>a</R> <R>a</R> <R>any</R> any Japanese before I came here. <F>Er</F> <R>a</R> <R>a</R> and every day, I'm <R>constantly</R> constantly amazed <R>a</R> <R>a</R> <R>a</R> at the Japanese I can use. <F>Erm</F> <F>er</F> then I go home to my host parents, <R>and</R> and I feel stupid <F>erm</F> because <SC>they s</SC> my host mom would speak to me <R>in</R> in Japanese and then <SC>spea</SC> say the same thing <R>in</R> in English. <F>Erm</F> so <R>i</R> it helps me out. <CO>But <R>I</R> <SC>I just don't</SC> <F>erm</F> <F>er</F> <SC>a lot of it</SC> <SC>I</SC> <F>er</F> there's so much more for me to understand</B>
<A><?>I'm sure</?>. <OL><??></??></OL></A>
<B><OL><?>how</?></OL></CO>. Yeah.</B>
<A>They have been here a lot.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. First of all, I'd like to show you a map.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL> I'd like you to describe this. <.></.> <?><F>Well</F> <F>ur</F></?> describe what you see here.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> it's a map of a school, <F>er</F> bank offices, zoo, <F>ur</F> apartment building, restaurant, hospital, public library, bookstore, post office, <F>er</F> bus station, supermarket, movie theaters. <F>Er</F> there's the South River. <F>Erm</F> there's roads <F>er</F> and a train station in the upper left-hand corner, and then the North River on the top part of <F>er</F> the picture. <F>Er</F>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>What's your impression of this town?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> my impression is that it's very residential community. <F>Erm</F> and <R>there</R> there seems to be a lot of trees, <F>er</F> but at the same time, there also seems to be a lot of train lines running into it. So I imagine it's, you know, suburban community <F>er</F> where most people would commute into the city.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <SC?>Were you</SC?> <F>er</F> <F>uh</F> I'm sorry, where do you actually live in the States?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <H pn="others8">XXX11</H>.</B>
<A>In <H pn="others8">XXX11</H>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>So that is very different <R>from</R> from this.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <R>I</R> I live in the suburbs of <H pn="others8">XXX11</H>. <OL><F>Erm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> public transportation in <H pn="others8">XXX11</H> is very poor. <F>Er</F> <SC>there</SC> <SC>the</SC> there is a very limited public transportation system.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> especially when it comes to the suburbs, <F>er</F> <R>every</R> everyone has to drive in the suburbs. <F>Er</F> even if you want to take the train into the city, <F>er</F> you have to drive to the train station.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> nearest train station from my house is up three miles.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> so <SC>i</SC> <R>yo</R> <SC>you have to</SC> <F>erm</F> I mean the nearest bus route is couple miles away. <F>Er</F> public transportation is <F>er</F> it's completely unfeasible</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><F>er</F></OL> <R>to</R> to use as means to get around.</B>
<A>So to go downtown, you drive.</A>
<B>You drive. Yeah.</B>
<A>But I would imagine, I have never been to <H pn="others8">XXX11</H>, but <?>from</?> I remember, <F>er</F> parking is a problem. <R>How do you</R> how do you find a parking space?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <R>you</R> you pay ten dollars and park in a garage. <.></.> Yeah. <R>Or</R> <R>or</R> or you drive around for an endless amount of time <F>er</F> circling the same block looking for a parking spot <F>er</F> <.></.> which is cheaper. But, yeah, on the other hand, it takes forever.</B>
<A>Right. <OL><?>I see</?></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Er</F></OL> you know, <R>it's</R> it's typical new American city. You know, it wasn't designed <R>for</R> for cars. So the streets are small, narrow. <F>Er</F>. <OL><??></??></OL></B>
<A><??></??> <?>of surprise if there're like the transportation systems</?>.</A>
<B>Yeah. Yeah. <R>I</R> <R>it</R> <SC>it's very</SC> <F>er</F> <.></.> <R>the</R> <R>the</R> there's lots of <SC>public</SC> <F>er</F> parking. Like there's plenty of parking garages. <SC>You can always</SC> <R>there</R> there is always plenty of space</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>in the parking garages <R>ju</R> just not necessarily on the street.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>Er</F>.</B>
<A>Then there goes ten dollars for <?>renting out</?>.</A>
<B>Yeah. You have to have <SC>ten dollars</SC> ten to fifteen dollars <F>er</F> to park for the day.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. But now you live in <F>er</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <R>How</R> how is the area that you live with your host family different from the area in the suburbs of <H pn="others8">XXX11</H>?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <F>mm</F> now <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I can get anywhere I want by public transportation.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <R>the</R> the subway station is <F>er</F> about five-minute walk from my house.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> to get here to school, it's about fifteen-minute walk from the train station. <F>Erm</F> which at home, if I were to walk to the train station, it would take me forty-five minutes, one hour. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> <SC?>how</SC?> everything I need is within walking distance <R>or</R> or within biking distance. <F>Er</F> post office, <F>er</F> the store, <F>er</F> getting my hair cut, <R>a</R> <R>anyth</R> anything I need <R>is</R> is right around the corner <F>er</F> <R>a</R> as opposed to in <SC><H pn="others8">XXX11</H></SC> <F>er</F> the <H pn="others8">XXX11</H> suburbs where you'd have to drive for all of that. <F>Erm</F> <SC>there is no <.></.> s</SC> <F>ur</F> <F>er</F> just recently, they built a shopping center next to my house. <CO>But even that is a fifteen-minute walk <R>to</R> to get to,</B>
<A>Next to <OL>your house, <laughter><?>right</?></laughter></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>yeah, yeah, yeah</OL> next to</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><F>Er</F></OL>.</B>
<A><laughter>O K</laughter>. I understand.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>O K. I'd like to show you a picture of a restaurant next, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. I'd like you to describe this <F>er</F> restaurant in detail.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> this restaurant, <F>er</F> there is a woman in the back playing the piano <F>er</F> next to a grandfather clock. <F>Er</F> <R>i</R> in the foreground, there is <F>er</F> <F>uh</F> <R>a w</R> a waiter <F>er</F> presenting a bottle of wine <F>er</F> to a couple eating dinner, a man and a woman. <F>Erm</F> the gentleman appears to be sampling <F>er</F> the wine. <F>Erm</F> <F>er</F> people in the background <F>er</F> on the right-hand side, a gentleman is serving <F>er</F> what I presume would be the entrees. <F>Er</F> on left-hand side, <F>er</F> the couple appears to be eating. <F>Erm</F> and the entrance, <?>abacus</?> <F>oh</F> rope across it. <F>Er</F> and <.></.> that's about it.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Have you managed to find a <F>er</F> favorite restaurant that you like so far?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> here? <F>Er</F> <.></.> not really. <R>I</R> I never seem to eat at the same place twice.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A>So tell me <OL>about the</OL> last place you went to.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>. <F>Er</F> the last place I went to was <F>er</F> the sushi restaurant with <R>the</R> the belt.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> <OL>yes</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Restaurant</OL> <F>erm</F> <R>whi</R> which is <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> very interesting concept to say the least. <F>Erm</F> <R>to</R> to know exactly how much you are paying <F>er</F> based on the color plate that you pull off <F>er</F> <R>i</R> <R>i</R> <R>is</R> is very interesting. <F>Erm</F> I ate with one of my friends and her parents. <F>Er</F> and they were pulling off <F>er</F> the shiny plates which, of course, are the more expensive ones.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Er</F> because the nicer the plate looks, <F>er</F> the more money <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> you are paying. <F>Er</F> and <R>they were</R> they were pulling off, for the most part, just shiny plates <R>for</R> for me to eat. <F>Erm</F> <R>and</R> and they were eating <R>all the</R> all the lower and cheaper plates. <F>Er</F> <F>er</F> the sushi wasn't good <R>from</R> from what I was told. <F>Er</F> <R>I</R> I can't really tell the difference. <F>Erm</F> because I never had sushi before I came here. <F>Er</F> and it tasted fine to me. <R>But</R> but they apologized for how bad the sushi was and told me <R>they</R> they would never go back to that restaurant again. <F>Erm</F> and, yeah, <R>that was my</R> that was my last experience of <laughter>restaurant</laughter>.</B>
<A>Right, right. What have you done for entertainment?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> entertainment. Yesterday, I went down to Ikebukuro.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> to the Sunshine City.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Er</F></OL> saw the aquarium <F>er</F> which is on the roof <R>of</R> <F>er</F> of the building, <F>er</F> which is very different to watch seals bounce balls on their nose <F>er</F> <F>er</F> you know, at <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> two hundred feet in the air. <F>Erm</F> <F>er</F> and went to Starbucks to have a cup of coffee. And then went and saw a movie, <F>er</F> "Triple X" <F>er</F> <OL>with Vin Diesel</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I <SC>had</SC> almost had to fill a personal loan application <R>to</R> to be able to afford <F>er</F> the movie. <OL><F>Er</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>That was</OL> the first time.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> it's second time I've seen the movie. <F>Er</F> <R>i</R> it's incredibly expensive <F>er</F> especially for a movie <R>that</R> that, you know, <R>I</R> I could've seen it over the summer. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> yeah, <R>i</R> <R>i</R> <SC>it's</SC> <R>i</R> <R>i</R> <R>it</R> it's funny you're paying more money to see something later <R>than</R> than Americans.</B>
<A>Right, right.</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Erm</F> <F>er</F> that's pretty much what I do. <F>Er</F> you go to the bar or the club,</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B><F>erm</F> and get liquored up <R>before</R> before you go, <F>er</F> so you can save a few bucks, <F>erm</F> stop at the convenience store which is nice. Because in <H pn="others9">XXX12</H>, <F>er</F> the convenience stores can't sell alcohol.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>

<A>I'm gonna change it a little bit. I want you to try <R>a</R> a role-play.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>I want you to imagine this scenario here, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, if you don't mind.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<A>O K. I'm gonna be the travel agent.</A>
<B>O K.</B>

<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Um</F> yes. Good afternoon, sir. Can I help you?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> yeah. <R>I</R> I booked a trip through travel agency <F>er</F> to Shanghai. <F>Er</F> and it was supposed to be a, you know, very luxurious. <F>Er</F> but it turned out to be anything but <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> luxurious. <F>Erm</F> the hotel room which I was promised to be five star <F>er</F> <R>w</R> <R>w</R> was no better <R>than</R> than a Holiday Inn. <F>Erm</F> and the food <R>that was</R> that was served <R>wa</R> <R>was</R> was <R>barely</R> barely edible when <F>er</F> what was described in the travel brochure <R>wa</R> was supposed to be <F>er</F> food beyond my wildest imagination.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> you have to understand, sir, <F>er</F> <R>a</R> <R>a</R> a five-star hotel in America is different from a five-star hotel in China.</A>

<B><F>Er</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I think it's just being packed in like sardines <F>erm</F> <R>i</R> <R>is</R> is an amazing thing. <F>Erm</F> <SC>and sitting there</SC> <F>er</F> <.></.> I think falling asleep <R>is</R> <R>is</R> is the most interesting thing. <F>Erm</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I</SC> <.></.> <SC>every</SC> <R>thi</R> this morning, <R>I w</R> I was on Sobu <JP>sen</JP>. <F>Er</F> and standing up, <R>I</R> I was half asleep <F>er</F> just like the person next to me <F>erm</F> because I was tired. <R>A</R> <R>an</R> and they were tired, too. And so you just kind of doze off <R>in</R> <R>into a</R> into a half asleep <F>er</F> while you are standing and being shaken around by the train.</B>
<A>Still not waking up.</A>
<B><F>Eh</F> <F>eh</F> yeah. <R>You</R> you wake up when the train stops. You look up, check what station you are at, and then fall back asleep standing.</B>
<A><..></..> <??></??> Pretty good. Yeah.</A>

<A>O K. <F>Er</F> one more <F>er</F> sequence of pictures I'd like to show you, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. <F>Er</F> going from one to six again <F>erm</F> like this. Please make up a story. And again, this happened before. So please start, "One day last week". <??></??>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. <F>Er</F> one day last week, <F>er</F> driving down the road, <F>er</F> and all the sudden, <F>er</F> <SC>before</SC> in front of me is a gentleman on a scooter <F>er</F> talking on his cell phone <F>er</F> <F>er</F> probably to <R>s</R> some female, <F>er</F> very distracting. <F>Er</F> <R>I</R> I come around a corner and <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> <F>eh</F> either I hit the scooter <R>or</R> or he hit, you know, my car. <R>I'm</R> I'm not exactly sure what happened. <F>Er</F> but <SC>ph</SC> cell phone fell on the ground. <R>There is</R> there is a bunch of damage <R>to the</R> to <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> his scooter. <F>Er</F> called the police. The police came. We filled out <R>a</R> <R>a</R> an accident report. <F>Erm</F> not exactly sure <R>how</R> how the accident report will work out, whose favor. <F>Erm</F> but <F>er</F> a truck came <R>and</R> and it took away <R>the</R> the scooter <F>er</F> to the shop. <F>Er</F> and I went on my way.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Er</F> do you have a car back home, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>I did.</B>
<A>Did?</A>
<B>I did, yeah. <R>It</R> it <OL><R>no longer</R></OL></B>
<A><OL>What happened to it</OL>?</A>
<B>no longer functions. <F>Erm</F> <R>i</R> in the state of <H pn="others9">XXX12</H>, <R>they</R> they insist on having your car inspected every year. <.></.> And this past year, for my car to pass the inspection would have cost anywhere between two thousand and three thousand dollars. I purchased the vehicle <F>er</F> <SC>five years ago</SC> no, <R>f</R> <F>er</F> four years ago for two thousand dollars. <F>Er</F> and since then, <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I put on about seventy thousand miles, eighty thousand miles. <F>Er</F> so paying a little bit more than what I paid for the vehicle to begin with just to get it to pass inspection <R>for</R> for one year, <F>er</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I found it a little bit extreme, <F>er</F> <F>uh</F> especially when I can buy a better car <R>for</R> for a little less miles on it. <F>Er</F> not to mention the fact that I didn't have two thousand dollars <F>er</F> to pay for the car. <F>Er</F> <SC>it happened in</SC> <R>I</R> I guess that happened last October. <F>Er</F> so I was at school at the time. <F>Erm</F> I stayed at school all year <F>er</F> over the summer, and then I came here. And <SC>I w</SC> I can't use the car while I'm here. So hopefully when I go back, <F>er</F> money will magically appear <F>erm</F> and I will get a car. Or <F>erm</F> be at school the entire next year and it won't matter anyway.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Er</F> so <R>ei</R> <R>ei</R> <R>ei</R> either way, <F>er</F> they will work out.</B>
<A>What happened to the old car?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> it <F>mm</F> now belongs to <F>erm</F> Volunteers of America, I think. <F>Er</F> <R>i</R> <R>i</R> <R>i</R> it actually was <R>a</R> a good tax right off,</B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL></A>
<B><OL><F>er</F></OL> for my parents.</B>
<A><SC>How did you</SC> <R>how</R> how was that done? How was that arranged?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> in America, <R>you</R> you can donate your car <F>er</F> to charity. And then right off the full retail value of the car <F>er</F> as a tax deduction.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. It's something <R>they're</R> they're pushing really big now. <F>Erm</F> <R>i</R> <R>i</R> it's a great way <SC>to</SC> <F>er</F> rather than trying to sell your car. <F>Erm</F> <SC>to</SC> <R>i</R> <R>i</R> <R>i</R> it really helps, depending on what tax pack you are in. <F>Er</F> if you're in a higher tax packet, <R>you</R> <R>you</R> you can save pretty much, <R>e</R> exactly how much money <R>you</R> <R>you</R> you would have gotten of if you would have <R>s</R> <F>er</F> sold the car, or even more sometimes. I donated, <?>yeah</?>.</B>
<A>Certainly more than having to pay for that inspection.</A>
<B>Yeah. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>So it was a</OL> very logical decision.</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Oh</F> yeah.</B>
<A>What was your best memory with that car you put eighty thousand miles on?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Wow</F>. Best memory that I can record on tape?</B>

<B><..></..></B>
<A>Is it <??></??> tape out of it?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Er</F>. <OL><?>Yeah</?></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><SC>Tell me</OL> something</SC> <R>t</R> tell me some <OL><??></??> you went</OL> with the car</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Erm</F>.</B>

<B><F>Er</F> <?>yeah</?>. Gee, I just drove it all over the place <SC><laughter>around</laughter> my</SC> to work mostly. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> I mean hundreds of trips back and forth to work. <F>Er</F> <F>eh</F> just driving, because for some reason, <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> I put on a lot of miles <R>dating</R> dating a girl who lived about twenty miles from my house, <F>er</F> that was about forty miles</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><R>ev</R> every other day.</B>
<A>That would put on a lot of <OL>miles</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Erm</F></OL> <R>for</R> for looking back on it, no good reason. <F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A>At the time.</A>
<B>But at the time, <R>it was</R> it was an exceptionally good reason to drive forty miles <F>er</F> in one day.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Erm</F> may I ask, what kind of car would you like to have when you get back? I mean, <OL>so you just <??></??></OL></A>
<B><OL><SC?>I love to</SC?> <R>I'd</R> I'd like</OL> the James Bond's car. <?>I mean</?> I would like <R>the</R> the B M W Z three Roadster. <F>Erm</F> but <SC>being that</SC> <F>er</F> financially, <R>I</R> I'm not in any condition to afford that <F>er</F> regardless of what I've told B M W dealerships when I've test driven on. <F>Erm</F> <F>er</F> <R>just</R> just a cheap car <R>that</R> <SC>that goes</SC> <.></.> that starts.</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
