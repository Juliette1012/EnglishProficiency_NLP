<A>My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. Can I have your name, please?</A>
<B><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Yes. That's good.</B>
<A>O K. How are you today, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Good. Doing well.</B>
<A>O K. Have you had lunch?</A>
<B>Yes. I just ate.</B>
<A>What did you have for lunch?</A>
<B>I had <JP>obento</JP> that my host mom made me.</B>
<A><OL><F>Wow</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So I had some</OL> bread with peanut cream and then some more bread with cream cheese, some pudding and orange, and I had iced tea.</B>
<A>She makes you that every day?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> it's different every day. <F>Oh</F> and salad, too. <OL><CO>But yeah</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>No, what I mean is</OL> she makes you <R>a</R> a <OL><JP>bento</JP> <?>every day</?></OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Oh</F> lunch</OL>. Every day. Yeah.</B>
<A>That's amazing.</A>
<B>She's really sweet.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> That's <OL>totally amazing</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>She's really sweet</OL>.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Er</F> <R>whe</R> where are the host family? Where do you live?</A>
<B>I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, <SC>which is</SC> <F>well</F> it's really not that far from here. It's like in twenty-minute drive if you go by car.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>And <F>erm</F> by trains and walking to and from stations, it takes about forty-five minutes at the best.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A>So <SC>that's how you get there</SC> I mean your host mom <?>doesn't bring you here</?> by car.</A>
<B>No. <SC>I usually</SC> yeah, <SC>more often</SC> almost always I take the train.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><?>Yeah</?>. <OL><nvs>sniff</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>And</OL> what do you do here <?>usually</?>?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I'm studying here, and I'm taking some classes. And then on Wednesdays, I do field placement at <F>er</F> <H pn="company name1">XXX04</H>, <nvs>sniff</nvs> which is a company <SC>they</SC> that produces semiconductor equipment.</B>
<A>What do you do at <H pn="company name1">XXX04</H>?</A>
<B>At <H pn="company name1">XXX04</H>? <F>Er</F> not so much, actually. <laughter>I</laughter> spend a lot of time in front of the computer or in meetings. <F>Erm</F> <R>my</R> my function, actually, is to update <H pn="others2">XXX05</H> documentation. But it's a really slow process, and a lot of the times I just spend <F>um</F> cutting and pasting Word documents or reformatting. <F>Erm</F> otherwise, I talk to other people in the company and surf the Web and so on. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><SC>From a</SC> from the program's point of view, what's the point of you being there?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> from the program's point of view, <SC>I'm s</SC> it's actually <F>erm</F> part of one of my classes. I'm supposed to be a participant observer and go there and make like anthropological observations about how people interact and how they communicate. And <SC>I'm</SC> I have my own goals <SC>to</SC> like I wanna study how people interact with their managers, or how is it different from working <SC>at this</SC> at a company in the United States, and trying to note similarities and differences between those. Then eventually <SC>I'll write</SC> <F>erm</F> I'll prepare like a booklet or, I guess, write a report that'll have other papers and reflections from when I was working there throughout the semester.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. And what have you noticed so far about the <OL>anthropological</OL> interactions?</A>
<B><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>. <F>Well</F> I think sometimes it's really hard, because it's kind of boring. But <SC>other</SC> one of the most interesting things I've noticed is that <SC>people have</SC> <F>well</F> <SC>they do a lot of</SC> they interact a lot with the company in the U S, which is in <F>erm</F> <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> or in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>. And I've noticed that a lot of times they have a really hard time communicating, because the American people just assume that the Japanese people know English, and the Japanese people don't really understand it that well. And they have a hard time communicating or expressing their own ideas in English. And so there's a lot of communication breakdown, or like even in the meetings, sometimes they seem to go around in circles and</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>without <R>any</R> any conclusions are drawn by the end of the meeting. <OL><F>Well</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <F>Hm</F>. O K. <R>Apart from</R> apart from the program here,</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>how have you been enjoying your free time?</A>
<B>My free time. <F>Oh</F> <SC>I've been doing</SC> <F>well</F> <SC>I was</SC> earlier, I was taking a lot of trips, like, when we had holidays. Like, I went to Kyoto and Nara with my host sisters. <F>Erm</F> but a lot of times, I'll just end up taking day trips, like to Ueno or into Tokyo or <F>erm</F> Kamakura, various places that are outside of the city that I can go in the day and be back.</B>
<A>What <OL>places</OL></A>
<B><OL><CO><?>I wen</?></CO></OL>.</B>
<A><F>uh</F> appeal to you <?>now</?> so far?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> actually, I went to Ueno and I really liked that, because I went to the museums. And then I'm planning on going again this weekend with my host sister. And there's a exhibit there that I really wanna see. So I really liked Ueno. I like Kamakura. <F>Erm</F> I had a good time in Kyoto, actually, when we went there, too. I guess it's not only a day trip, but it was really nice <F>erm</F> to see a different part of Japan and <OL>the landscape</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>So the more historical</OL> type places.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I think so. Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>For the most part. <SC>I <SC>ha</SC> don</SC> I haven't really had opportunity that much to experience the nightlife, because we live a little bit far from the city. And then you can't stay out too late because, like, the trains will shut down and whatnot. So <R>I haven'</R> I haven't really gone out at night <OL>that much</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>How old</OL> are these <F>er</F> sisters?</A>
<B>My host sisters are twenty-one and twenty-three. And so, yeah, we get along really well.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><R>What</R> what differences do you notice between, for example, yourself,</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>you're what, twenty-one?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>And the twenty-one-year-old Japanese girl?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> actually <R>I think</R> I think maybe, as far as what we like to do, <R>we're</R> we're a lot alike. <F>Erm</F> a lot of the differences maybe just center around the family life. Like, I haven't lived at home for <SC>almost</SC> <F>well</F> more than three years now. And so <R>it's</R> it's kind of strange to see <SC>how</SC> like how she interacts with her mom and like <SC>how</SC> she's still living at home or <SC>she</SC> actually I think she will be living at home for a while still. And so it's interesting to see like how she interacts with her family, whereas when I go home, it's usually just for the weekend or maybe, at the most, like two and a half or three weeks for a Christmas vacation. And so <F>erm</F> it's good. But I think like as far as maybe her relationship with her friends or going out with her friends and having fun, you know, she does a lot of the same things, probably. Or just <?>removed</?> in place, but,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>you know, like, similar activities.</B>
<A>All right. <F>Well</F> makes sense. Yeah.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. First of all, I'd like to show you <R>a</R> <R>a</R> a picture. We have <SC>s</SC> various tasks that we have to do.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>I'd like to show you a picture.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Er</F> could you describe this picture in detail, please?</A>
<B>O K. <F>Erm</F>.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the picture.</ctxt>
<B>Looks like <R>in this</R> in this sketch, there's a math teacher who's trying to describe some sort of algebra concept to her class. It <SC>is</SC> probably looks like maybe a sixth- or seventh- grade class, and she's having a difficult time keeping the attention of the students. One person is chewing gum. Another person is talking on her cell phone or sending messages on her cell phone. Another person is drinking, and two girls are talking. One is doing her nails. <F>Erm</F> <nvs>sigh</nvs> <F>well</F> there is like one student that's looking up at the chalkboard and he looks thoroughly confused. And the teacher seems completely unaware that the students <F>er</F> have no interest at all whatsoever in what's going on in the class. <F>Erm</F> maybe, it looks a little bit <R>possi</R> possibly, like an actual junior high classroom. But <R>a little bit</R> a little bit exaggerated. <F>Er</F> I think most students wouldn't be so blatant about <R>their</R> <laughter>their</laughter>, I guess their obvious disrespect to the teacher, but it's <F>erm</F> <R>maybe</R> maybe an exaggeration, a little bit. <OL><CO>But</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>If you were this teacher,</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>how would you try to get their attention?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <F>wow</F>. <F>Erm</F> <SC>I think</SC> <nvs>sigh</nvs> I don't know anything about teaching, but I think <SC>a lot of times</SC> one of my teachers, what he would do, when I was in high school, was he would just stop talking. And then once the students realized <R>that</R> that he wasn't teaching, <R>then they'd</R> <SC>then they'd stop listening and</SC></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I mean, then they'd stop performing the other activities and look up and wonder why the teacher wasn't teaching. But <R>I don</R> I don't know. I guess you could yell, too. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>Maybe that's not the most <laughter><R>constructive</R></laughter> constructive method.</B>
<A>O K. Generally speaking,</A>
<B><OL><?>Yes</?></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>what was</OL> the atmosphere like in your high school?</A>
<B>In my high school?</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <SC>the atmosphere is really</SC> it was really interesting in high school because we had two programs. We had <R>a</R> a magnet program, then we had the regular students <?>or</?> the grade school students. And <F>erm</F> my high school was <.></.> kind of in the ghetto. And <laughter>so</laughter> <R>we didn'</R> <SC>we didn't usually have</SC> like the magnet students that came from all over the city didn't usually have the students with the home school students that went there. And so the atmosphere <R>is</R> is really different. Like in the classroom, <SC>all</SC> most of the time the students were fairly attentive. Classes were small. And <F>erm</F> <R>it</R> it would usually be, usually productive class, I think. <F>Erm</F> if you went out in the hallway during passing periods, it was totally different. <F>Erm</F> students are really rowdy. Every <?>now and then</?> you'd been in class, and like someone would just go around yelling in the hallways. You don't know what he or she was saying. <F>Er</F> <R>it was really</R> it was really interesting. It was very intercultural, I guess.</B>
<A>Yeah, <R>with</R> with one <F>er</F> set of students here and a totally different set of students here,</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>er</F> <R>wa</R> <R>wa</R> wasn't there any friction between these two groups of people?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. <.></.></B>
<A>Some stigmatizing <OL><?>relations</?> between the two</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><SC>I don't</SC> <SC>I think s</SC></OL> I think maybe there was some friction. I think a lot of times, <SC>the</SC> <.></.> like <R>the</R> the staff or <R>the</R> <F>well</F> the faculty would try not to <F>erm</F> give exclusive rights to one group or the other. But <R>maybe</R> <F>erm</F> maybe like <SC>s</SC> <SC>lo</SC> <SC>some of the magnet kids might have</SC> <F>oh</F> <SC>may</SC> <R>s</R> some of the grader school kids might have earned the resentment of the magnet kids because perhaps like the magnet students <R>couldn't</R> couldn't perform an activity because it would be unfair if the grade school students couldn't, or <F>er</F> maybe the grade school students felt resentful towards the magnet school students because they felt like the magnet students got more rights because they're more productive in class, or they might take another field trip that they didn't, or something along those lines. <nvs>sniff</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. O K. Great.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>One more picture I'd like you to describe for me. It's a picture of a restaurant.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>If you could describe this in detail.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Erm</F> in this picture, it looks like there's a man and a woman out on a date. A waiter <R>is</R> is coming by with a cart and he is presenting them <R>with some</R> <.></.> with some wine. It <SC>looks like the man is</SC> looks like he's probably gonna taste the wine and then <R>go ahead and</R> go ahead and tell the waiter whether he wants to continue drinking it and pour some for his date or not. And it's probably a pretty nice restaurant. In the back, <SC>there's playin</SC> there's someone playing the piano. And it's around dinnertime. It's seven o'clock. And there are some other nicely dressed couples in the background. <F>Er</F> pretty much the same situation. <R>Nothing</R> nothing extraordinary. <F>Er</F> looks like they're just enjoying a pleasant evening out.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Have you been to <R>a</R> <R>a</R> a nice, fancy restaurant in Japan at all?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> no. Not in Japan.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hmm</F>. Where do you usually eat <SC?>if <OL>yo</SC?> <F>er</F></OL> except with your host family, of course?</A>
<B><OL><F>Erm</F></OL>. <nvs>sigh</nvs> <F>Wow</F>. <F>Erm</F> don't really go out that much. <SC>Usually if I</SC> I've been out with the friends a couple of times. And we'll just go to a nearby restaurant. <SC>If</SC> for lunch, like we'll just stop at any place and eat. Just really small restaurants. For dinner, <F>er</F> one time I went with one of my host sisters <R>to</R> to a bar for a going-away party for her friends. And <SC>I think</SC> <F>er</F> we just went out and we drank and ate a lot. And it was probably just like any other Japanese small restaurant. <SC>It wasn'</SC> actually, I didn't even think it was a bar, it was more like a restaurant. And we went there. <F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A>How was that different from a restaurant like this?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> that. It was different. <F>Well</F> <SC>we sat on</SC> excuse me, <SC>we sat like</SC> we sat <SC>underneath the table</SC> <F>well</F> not underneath the table, but <R>the</R> the table was <F>er</F> lower. And so <SC>i</SC> I don't know how else to explain it. <F>Erm</F> and <SC>we</SC> it was an Asian atmosphere. A lot of the food was different. <R>It wasn't</R> it wasn't really nice. Like <SC>it was just</SC> it was a very casual place. And the place in the picture looks like it's actually a kind of a formal place where people might go to eat <R>on a</R> on a really nice evening for some special occasion.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, if I may ask, how did you get interested in Japan, Japanese in the first place?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I am an engineering major. And <R>I got</R> I got really tired of just taking engineering classes over and over. And so I wanted to take a class where I could learn something and also be interested in it, and just take a class because I wanted to learn, and not because I had to take it for a requirement. And I didn't wanna worry about what kind of <R>grade I</R> <SC>grade I wa</SC> grade I would earn. I just wanted to go and learn something. And so I thought a foreign language would be a really good way to do that. And I decided that <R>Japanese would be</R> Japanese would be a good language, because maybe if I wanted to pursue a career in business or <F>erm</F> something along those lines, then Japanese might prove to be very useful in that way.</B>
<A>I see. O K. Great.</A>

<task>
<A>O K. I'd like to do a series of role-plays with you.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A><F>Erm</F> first of all, this one here. If you could just read this to yourself, this is a scenario. I want you to figure that out.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Then I'll play the part.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K? I'm gonna be the building manager.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Er</F> ring-ring. <F>Er</F> ring. Hello? This is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H> here.</A>
<B>Hi, this is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> in A-one.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. How are you?</A>
<B>I'm doing fine. <F>Er</F> I have kind of a problem with my apartment. I came <OL>home</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>?</A>
<B>from classes today and <R>the</R> the window in my bedroom is broken.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B><OL><CO>And</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>That's</OL> something.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> yeah. Do you think you could fix it sometime soon?</B>
<A><F>Er</F> it just broke?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I came home from classes. I don't know if somebody threw something at it or <F>er</F> if there was some crack beforehand and nobody really noticed. But <R>I</R> I don't know how it happened. It's just broken. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K. <F>Erm</F> I'm kind of busy right now.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Well</F> <F>uh</F> can you give me some sort of date, like possibly tomorrow or later today or hopefully by the end of the week, because it is kind of cold outside.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> I'm a bit tied up. I mean, and it's not that cold.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <R>it is</R> it is really cold at night, actually. And so <R>I wouldn't</R> I wouldn't want to have any problems because it's too cold at night.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <SC>you could</SC> <F>er</F> how about some taping? Maybe <F>er</F> you could <R>pu</R> put a magazine over the hole or something like that. I can drop off some brown tape, maybe?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <R>that's a</R> that's a great temporary solution. But <F>er</F> I think <SC>you are</SC> you should be obligated to fix this window sometime soon.</B>
<A><F>Erm</F> I would love to. You know, <SC>it's just</SC> <F>er</F> Sunday, maybe?</A>
<B>Sunday. <F>Oh</F> what's today? <R>Tue</R> Tuesday?</B>
<A>Thursday.</A>
<B>Today's Thursday? Friday, Saturday. Do you think you could come on Saturday? I'm busy on Sunday.</B>
<A><F>Erm</F> I guess it's possible. <F>Erm</F> I'm not sure about the time.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Erm</F> <F>hm</F> <SC>should I call you</SC> I think Sunday should probably be O K. <F>Erm</F> are you gonna call me back or <R>should I</R> should I <OL>call you to make sure</OL>?</B>
<A><OL>Yeah, <F>er</F></OL> I don't mind calling you back. <F>Erm</F> no problem at all.</A>
<B>O K. All right.</B>
<A>I might have to bill you for it, though. I mean, it's not like it's our responsibility or anything.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> I understand. But <R>it's also</R> <.></.> it's also not my fault, either. So I don't understand how you could bill me for it, possibly.</B>
<A>It's not like I broke the window.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> it's not like I broke the window either.</B>
<A><F>Erm</F> O K. <F>Well</F> let's talk about that <OL>on Sunday</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah, <SC>def</SC></OL> we can talk about that. Or <F>er</F> maybe I might call <R>the</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> the <??></??>, <F>er</F> people who own the apartment and I might talk to them, too, about it.</B>
<A><F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> you probably won't need to go that far.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I'm sure</OL> I can arrange something.</A>
<B>O K. Thank you.</B>
<A>O K. <laughter>Thank you very much</laughter>.</A>
<B>Bye.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you. Bye-bye. That's the end of the role-play.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Now, <F>er</F> you said you haven't lived, <F>uh</F> <R>three</R> three years <F>uh</F> at home. So you've been living at college.</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A>Where is college?</A>
<B><H pn="school name1">XXX08</H> in <H pn="others5">XXX09</H>.</B>
<A>In <H pn="others5">XXX09</H>.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. <OL><R>And whe</R></OL></A>
<B><OL>Or just</OL> north of <H pn="others5">XXX09</H>, <OL>actually</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And where</OL> is home?</A>
<B><SC><H pn="others6">XXX10</H></SC> <F>well</F> <H pn="others7">XXX11</H>, <H pn="others8">XXX12</H>.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. <R>That's a</R> that's a long way.</A>
<B>It is far. Yeah.</B>
<A>That's a long way.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>And <SC>at</SC> up in <H pn="others5">XXX09</H> there, you have <R>a</R> <R>a</R> an apartment, or you live <F>uh</F> on campus?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> my first two years, I lived on campus. And then last year, I lived in apartment <?>with friends</?>. <F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Erm</F> what sort of difficulties are there in that apartment? Have you had any problems there?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> yeah. We did have some problems. Like, I think maybe the space was too small. There were four girls and it was three-bedroom apartment. And then <SC?>in the</SC?> this was in the fall quarter. And then in the winter quarter, we had five girls. And so <R>it was</R> it was really crowded. <F>Erm</F> a lot of times we had just problems with like who was obligated to take care of what. Especially there was one girl that like never did her dishes. <F>Er</F> and so like one of my other roommates would always get upset about her lack of tidiness. And <F>er</F> <SC>we had</SC> sometimes we had some hard times just like figuring out who was responsible for buying the next roll of toilet paper <R>or if</R> or if <F>er</F> garbage bags running out, who was responsible for buying this and that. I would have problems with <F>er</F> noise at night, because I like to <?>go to bed</?> earlier. And so sometimes that would irritate me. But <R>on the</R> on the whole, <SC>it was</SC> <nvs>sniff</nvs> it was O K, I think. <SC>It was</SC> <F>well</F> maybe it was just more like tolerable, because I knew it was temporary and not permanent.

<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And so it was</OL> nice to be around with <OL>them</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>. What's the biggest difference between living in an apartment and, <F>uh</F> campus life?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. <F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A>I guess it's a big change.</A>
<B>I guess. It might have been more different had I lived really far from campus. But I lived really close to campus. <F>Erm</F> maybe one of the differences is that it's possibly slightly less convenient. Like, I wouldn't go back to my apartment in between classes. I just learned to stay on campus during the day. <F>Um</F> <R>living</R> living on campus was difficult, because <SC>you have to</SC> you don't have your own space, really. <SC>You have to</SC> <SC>I was</SC> I would live with someone else when I was on campus. And anywhere you go, there is always people around, and you never have a place where you can go just for yourself, really, <SC>just</SC> if I wanted to study or anything. And then</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>when I was living in the apartment, it was nice to have that. I can go to my own room and study there and have some alone time.</B>

<A>O K. Next up, I'd like you to read this one. It's a travel scenario.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. If you could just read that one to yourself.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Erm</F> yes. Good afternoon, madam. How can I help you?</A>
<B>Hi. <F>Er</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. And I went on your <F>er</F> luxury tour <F>er</F> this past week <R>through</R> through the Northeast. And I have some problems with it. And I was wondering if there was someone I could talk to.</B>
<A>Sure. Which tour was that?</A>
<B>This was <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the <R>Luxury</R> Luxury Tour through the Northeast.</B>
<A>That was the name of the tour.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>Yes. <F>Er</F> I think I'm familiar with that tour.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>I was expecting</SC> <SC>I</SC> <R>whe</R> <R>when I booked the</R> <R>when I booked the</R> <F>er</F> when I booked the trip, I was expecting to be guided on this <F>er</F> fantastic bus tour, and we had expected that everything would be taken care of, like meals, and the <R>bus</R> <F>er</F> bus was supposed to be very comfortable, and I'm afraid that it wasn't at all. And so I was wondering <R>if</R> if there was any type of compensation I could receive for this.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> what do you mean it wasn't comfortable? <CO>I'm sure</CO>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>erm</F> like the driver wasn't friendly, and it was, like, the temperature was always uncomfortable. We asked him several times if we could open the windows or if he could turn up the A C. And <SC>he just</SC> he <SC>wa</SC> pretty much did everything except for refuse. <F>Erm</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <CO>We</CO>. <F>Er</F>.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> I'm sorry about that. <SC>The</SC> unfortunately, <R>the</R> <R>the</R> the driver works for the bus company. <R>We</R> we only have a contract with that company. We can't control the driver.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <R>when you</R> when you guarantee to your customers that the trip is supposed to be a luxurious one, I assume that you look into these types of factors before.</B>
<A><R>We</R> we do <F>er</F> choose the best company, of course. We can't go down to the level of the individual.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC>have you</SC> has anyone from your company ever actually been on this type of trip?</B>
<A><F>Erm</F> we've researched it.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC>I should</SC> I would think that before you go around making promises to your customers that <R>you would</R> you would do more than research it. Especially <R>if</R> if your relationship with your customer is going to be on the line for it.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> I do understand that. <F>Erm</F> but we only have a problem <R>of a</R> <R>of a</R> of a nasty individual. <R>The</R> the trip itself was wonderful, right?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> actually, a lot of the stops, <F>erm</F> we felt really rushed. <F>Erm</F> they promised us that we would have time to look around <SC?>and all</SC?> and do other types of activities. But we didn't really have that much time. We spent a lot more time on the bus than we'd expected.</B>
<A>It's traffic, you know. And nobody can control the traffic.</A>
<B>No. <SC>I don't</SC> I really don't think there was that much traffic. <F>Erm</F> it was just that, you know, <SC>I think</SC> I feel like they tried to take us to too many things and <SC>it wasn't</SC> it was not exactly <R>what</R> what we had anticipated, or it wasn't exactly how you had portrayed it to be <F>um</F> when we had <R>talked to</R> talked to your representative about this.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. O K, madam. <R>I</R> I will certainly look into it.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And I'll</OL> get back to you. And hopefully, we can come to some sort of arrangement.</A>

<A>O K, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, is this the first time you've been outside the States?</A>
<B>No. No, it's not.</B>
<A>Where have you been?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <SC>I've been to</SC> <F>well</F> my family travels a lot. Actually, <R>I've</R> I've been to India several times because I <R>have</R> have family there. And then</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> O K.</A>
<B><F>erm</F> we've also been to like Canada and Mexico for <R>brief</R> <R>brief</R> brief periods of time. And then I also went to Germany with my family, and spent some time in Italy, too, with one of my friends.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. With friends?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>How was that Italian trip? What did you <OL>do</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Er</F></OL> it was fine. It was just me and one of my best friends. And we went after our senior year, and we spent four weeks there just traveling around. We just had backpacks. I mean, <SC>I</SC> we can't really say we were backpacking, because we didn't just spend the night anywhere. But <F>erm</F> it was really fun because there were just two of us and we could make decisions easily and</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>er</F> just enjoy the countryside.</B>
<A>What did you end up doing?</A>
<B><F>Wow</F>. <R>We went</R> we went to a lot of places. <SC>We would go</SC> like every two or three days, we were going to different places. We went to <?>I think</?> <R>Rome and</R> Rome and Venice and Assisi. And <SC>we just</SC> we tried to do a lot. But we spent a lot of time walking, too, and eating, trying out the food.

<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K? O K. Yes. Good afternoon, madam. How can I help you?</A>
<B>Hi. <R>I just bought this</R> I just bought this shirt. And when I got home, <SC>I realized that it was the wrong</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> I just realized that it was the wrong size. I was wondering if I could exchange it for something else.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> basically, <F>er</F> <R>we d</R> we do have a policy against <F>er</F> exchanges or refunds.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> is there anything you can do? I mean <?>you know</?> I just bought it. You can see the receipt <SC>that I</SC> and there's no way I would've even had any time to wear it or anything.</B>
<A>Right. I'm just wondering <SC>you didn</SC> <F>uh</F> you knew your size when you bought it, right?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> yes. But <SC>I wasn't</SC> I was kind of in a rush and I didn't realize that it wouldn't fit.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I mean, not</OL> all the clothes are made exactly the same size.</B>
<A><F>Erm</F> which is why we have fitting rooms, of course.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <R>I'm s</R> I'm sorry, I didn't really have that much time. <F>Erm</F> could you make an exception just this once?</B>
<A>Just for you?</A>
<B>Please?</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F> that's very difficult, because what if all of our customers said the same thing? You know, it's extra paperwork. <OL>Extra administration</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Well</F></OL> I understand. But <SC>it wo</SC> I would really, really appreciate it. I mean <SC>it</SC> you can see it's exactly the same as when I bought it. It would mean a lot to me. Please.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F> put yourself <R>in</R> in my shoes. <F>Um</F> I have a job to do.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Well</F> I understand. Thank you.</B>
<A><F>Er</F> perhaps you could talk to my manager.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> yeah. That would be good. Do you think that's possible?</B>
<A>I think so. Maybe <F>erm</F> "Please" is probably not good enough. I mean <SC>maybe</SC> if you try to maybe exchange it for something exactly the same?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yeah. That would <OL>be great</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><?>Different size</?></OL>?</A>
<B>If I could exchange it for a better size, that would work out perfectly.</B>
<A>Same color, same material.</A>

<B><OL><F>Er</F> I bought</OL> a couple of things, not so much. Yeah. I bought some clothes. And what else? Just mostly I've bought food.</B>
<A>Browsed around in department stores?</A>
<B>Yeah. I have browsed around at the <OL>department stores</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh</F></OL> how do you find <F>oh</F> Japanese department stores?</A>
<B>Actually, a lot of the stuff in the department stores I liked. I think it's really classy. <F>Erm</F> and if I could afford it, <R>there's</R> there's a lot I would buy, I think.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. People say that the service is very good. How do you find <OL><?>it</?></OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Erm</F></OL> <SC>I think</SC> <F>wow</F> when I walk into the department stores, <SC>I</SC> sometimes I think it's kind of overbearing. Because <R>I'm</R> I'm one of those people that <SC>likes to</SC> you know, like, likes to look around by herself. And then if I need help, then <SC>I like</SC> I'd like someone to be around so I can solicit their help. But <R>I</R> <F>erm</F> I think, in the Japanese stores, sometimes it feels like people are always watching you and seeing you, you know, "Are you content? Are you finding everything you need?" Maybe a little bit overwhelming. But, yeah, <R>they are</R> they are nice. And if you talk to them, then they'll do anything they can to help you.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <SC>If you were gonna</SC> if you had that money and <SC>you</SC> <SC><OL>we</OL></SC></A>

<A>for example, there was some classy clothes you wanted to <OL>buy</OL>,</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><F>erm</F> when you buy clothes, what kind of things do you take into account?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <SC>I like really</SC> <SC>I'm</SC> I wanna know if they fit really well. And then <F>er</F> if I like the way they look and if I think that it's something that I can wear a lot and it's affordable, then I can buy it. <OL><CO>It's a</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>In that</R></OL> in that order.</A>
<B>Probably, yes. <SC>A lot of</SC> <F>well</F> when I'm shopping in the U S, a lot of times it's <F>er</F> finding clothes that fit me and that I like. And so if I find something that fits and that I like, and then if it's affordable, then I'll buy it.</B>

And <F>er</F> <SC>I don't</SC> like, just then the train came, and it went over. And <R>he was</R> he was really distressed, we were like, "<F>Oh</F> my gosh. What's gonna happen?

And then <R>the guy that</R> the guy that hit him, that made his bag fall onto the train, <SC>he got down on</SC> I guess he probably called someone or somebody called someone.

<A>Now, <SC>what's your</SC> what's the most curious thing you've seen on the infamous Japanese trains so far?</A>
<B>The most curious thing? <F>Oh</F> probably, <R>sometimes when we're</R> <F>oh</F> <F>well</F> sometimes when we're coming back from the city, there's always some strangely <R>dressed</R> dressed people. <F>Erm</F> <SC>there's a</SC> <SC>I guess there's</SC> <F>er</F> I guess they're either teenagers or <?>young</?> adults. And they have like <nvs>sniff</nvs> the white makeup and the black hair and big boots and buckles, kind of a Gothic appeal, <OL>possibly</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>It's kind of interesting. I mean <?>you just want to look at</?> <??></??> or whatever. You know, no big deal, I guess. But it's interesting because by far, the vast majority of people <R>are</R> are not dressed like that in Japan. <OL>So</OL></B>

<B>that makes it all the more stunning, I guess.</B>

<B><F>Wow</F>. The first time I had to do that was at the airport terminal. And <SC>it was really</SC> I just thought <R>it was</R> <F>er</F> it was so crowded. <R>I</R> I think it's pretty hellish. I don't really like it <R>at</R> at all. But <F>erm</F> <SC>kind of</SC> you just kind of deal with it and you do what anybody else does. I just stare out the window and pretend nobody else is there. <nvs>laughter</nvs> That's the way to deal, I think.</B>

And eventually the police come. And we're sitting there arguing. And <R>I</R> I showed the policeman that this guy was talking on his phone, which is, first of all, he shouldn't have even been doing that. So he wasn't paying attention to where he was going. And I'm sorry if I hit him, but it was really, more than anything, his fault. And so I talked to the policeman and whatever. And then finally, <R>they just</R> they just called the tow truck to get his scooter, and I went home. <SC>There</SC> fortunately, there wasn't really any major damage to my car.

<B><OL>The rest</OL> of the day. <F>Erm</F> afterwards <SC>I have to</SC> I'm supposed to study <F>ur</F> we'll see if that actually <laughter>happens</laughter>. <SC>And then I have class from</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <R>it never</R> it never actually works out that way. And then I have class from three-thirty to <SC>five-forty</SC> no, later, six-forty-five. And that's torture. And then I'll probably just go home and eat dinner and try to study for my exam tomorrow, if I can. <OL><F>Er</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>It's</OL> torture? Why is it torture?</A>
<B><SC>Because it</SC> <F>well</F> I don't really learn anything in class. <F>Erm</F> I have two classes. And <SC>one of them is</SC> one of them, the professor, he's a really interesting guy. But like the students take absolutely no interest in the class. And so there's never any possibility for discussion. He just talks on and on. <F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A>Pretty <OL><?>weird</?></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> <R>wha</R> what he has to say is interesting. But it's just like <R>the</R> <SC>the room</SC> like the atmosphere in the room is just so <?>insipid</?> that it just sucks the energy out of you. But <nvs>sniff</nvs> he's a cool guy. Like, I like talking to him after class and stuff. And then I have another class, <SC>which is</SC> <?>it is Japanese joined</?> American students. And <SC>I just</SC> it's just not really intellectually stimulating, I think. So I go to that. Then <R>I'll</R> I'll go home and eat dinner and study <?>homework</?>.</B>
<A>How much longer in this program?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> five and a half more weeks. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So <OL><??></??></OL></B>
<A><OL>So you'll be</OL></A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>

<B><OL>Right</OL> before Christmas, I go back. Yeah. Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. Any big challenges left <OL>while you're here</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Big challenges</OL>. <F>Erm</F> school work is getting more. I guess just in volume, it's increasing, because I have to write some papers and do some projects which, up until now, I've just been, "<F>Oh</F> that's in the distant future.". So that's coming up. <F>Erm</F> otherwise, not really. Things are just kind of like <?>bogus</?>. And so hopefully I'll get to travel a little bit more before I have to go back.</B>
<A>Yeah. You might as well. <OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I'd like to do that</OL>.</B>
<A>You might as well.</A>

<A>But you're looking forward to getting back?</A>
<B>I think so. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Enough</OL>. <OL>Enough, <?>isn't it</?></OL>?</A>
<B><OL>No, I mean</OL> <SC>it's not that</SC> it's not so much of that. But <SC>I'm</SC> like all my friends are <?>starting to</?> graduate. And I'm <R>getting</R> getting kind of anxious. Like I wanna <R>go</R> go back to school. Since March, I haven't been in school because I've been working or I've <OL>been here</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And so <SC>I think</SC> I really feel like it's time for me to go back and start</B>
