<A>O K. Let's begin. Hello. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have your name, please?</A>
<B>Yeah. I'm <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. <OL>Nice to meet you</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Nice to meet you</OL>, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Where're you from?</A>
<B>I'm from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, but <F>uh</F> <SC>suburb of</SC> right near <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. But</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>it's usually just easier to say <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>So what do you do in Japan?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> right now, I'm studying Japanese at the <H pn="school name1">XXX05</H>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ur</F> <SC>mainly I try to</SC> just I don't have a job right now like most students do, so I have more free time. So I try to have fun, and just study Japanese.</B>
<A>Right. I see. Can you tell me more about that school in <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Ur</F> <SC>at <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>, they have</SC> <F>well</F> we're not actually really part of the school. What we have is we have the foreign language program, and we mainly have classes on our own. So we're in classrooms in this school, but mostly you're in with the other students who are the <F>ur</F> foreign exchange students. And they're not really with the kind of students much because we don't have enough <SC>Japanese taker</SC> Japanese-taught course.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But we interact with them enough, and we meet them in the cafeteria and everything. <SC>I <F>ur</F> have</SC> my classes taught in Japanese are just <JP>kanji</JP> and Japanese. But then history and society and everything are taught in English. And <F>mm</F> most are just Americans in those classes.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see. O K. So you said you have a lot of free time.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>What do you do?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> <F>well</F> <R>I</R> I live in the dormitories. So lots of the people live at home, <F>ur</F> they <F>uh</F> do things with their families. And they go home, and they just do stuff with their families, and eat with them. And sometimes on the weekends, I go out and do things with them. So they actually have a lot less. When I ask them to do things, they're like, "<F>Oh</F> you know, I'm doing this stuff with my family.".</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So especially because I'm in the dorm, and I just live in a single by myself, it's pretty much at school, or I'm on my own. So I try to come up with things to do, but <F>ur</F> when there's really nothing to do, I play <F>uh</F> Gameboy in my room by myself <F>uh</F> because I have no T V or computer. But I like to go out a lot, on the weekends especially. This weekend, we're gonna go do karaoke. I've been doing that a lot recently. Usually with Japanese and Americans. Now, last weekend, we went to Shibuya, and just went to clubs, <R>and</R> <laughter>and</laughter> had fun. <F>Well</F> I'm going to a movie tonight. I usually don't do that though in Japan, because it's too expensive.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>But a movie just came out, <F>ur</F> "The Ring," and then I like horror movies a lot, and it looks pretty cool. So</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><laughter>I'm gonna</laughter> be there tonight.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. So why do you like horror movies so much?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <R>mo</R> <R>mo</R> <SC>mo</SC> mainly because they're <SC>funny</SC> a funny thing. <R>I</R> <SC>I watch</SC> most of the horror movies I watch aren't scary. They're just kind of stupid. And I don't really mind seeing lots of violence. And normally they're just badly made, and they're fun to watch with my friends. But then I also like the ones that are scary. And if they are scary, it's even better because <F>ur</F> I think having watched so many, they don't scare me at all anymore. <SC>So</SC> then I especially try to watch more and more <SC>hopefully</SC> hoping that one will scare me. And everyone keeps saying that this one is horribly frightening. So I hope it might get some sort of reaction out of me,</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>instead of just like, "<F>Oh</F> that's interesting" kind of reactions. <SC>But <F>mm</F> I</SC> <F>ur</F> but <R>mo</R> mostly I watch them because they're bad and stupid. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And it's fun to laugh at them.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A>All right. So <F>urm</F> you said you live in a dorm.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Urm</F></OL> why a dorm and not a home stay <OL><??></??></OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Well</F></OL> <F>oh</F> yeah. I thought about that. It was a big decision. <F>Ur</F> the two biggest choices I had to make was what city to come within, and <R>I</R> I chose easy one. I figured <R>it</R> <SC>it</SC> <F>ur</F> the program was called <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And like, "<F>Oh</F> <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>.". You know, I might as well go to the city that everyone knows. And if I talk about it, people would know about it. And it's a biggest one. Then we actually wound up living in <H pn="others6">XXX09</H>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> But <SC>it di</SC> it really didn't matter since we live so close to <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>. The other one was home stay or dorm. Most everyone picked home stay. My main reason was I don't like living with my family in America. And I love them, and I've known them <F>er</F> for a long time, but I can't stand living at home. <SC>It</SC> just not enough freedom. And I find having to do things annoying and having to be home for dinner at certain times, I find it very restrictive to just having fun with your friends. And I sort of assumed other people would feel the same way. But when I got here, it turned out everyone else is living in the homes. And only a couple of kids, there is four of us in the dorm. One of them ended up being one of my best friends.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And since we both have so much free time, we usually do everything together.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Like me and him are the only one who's going to the movie tonight.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Lots of people just have things to do. And at first, I felt really bad like when everyone was meeting their home stay families. I was <?>worried</?> <??></??> I felt numb because they were all meeting them, and <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> we were just sitting there. And they're like, "<F>Oh</F> they're gonna have such a good time.". And the first couple of weeks, the families took them places, and did things with them. And <R>we seem</R> we seem like we're left out. But now, when people wanna have fun, they come to us. And they complain about their families, and say, "<F>Oh</F> you know, it's great. We like them, but it's really annoying how we have to be home. And like they want me to go to this place this weekend, but I'd rather <?>come</?> <??></??> with you guys.". So now, we kind of feel better about it because we actually have a lot more freedom in a way. <F>Er</F> people come to us and say, "We wanna do something fun. What should we do?". Because <SC>we have</SC> we had to figure it out on our own. And our Japanese might be better at home. But we understand Japan better because we had to figure it out on our own, I think. And when we have to go get a new train pass, we just kind of have to go do it. Most people have their families fill out the stuff for them. So it's kind of getting take back and forth. But <F>eh</F> my main reason, <F>urm</F> speaking honestly, was a girls issue because <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I couldn't live in a house with a family if I expected to have girlfriends or girlfriend.</B>
<A>Right. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Yes.</B>
<A>Important?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Er</F> a girlfriend. And it's true <SC>I</SC> none of the home people do, and I do <SC>so</SC> because they just can't like it's their lifestyles aren't very permitting of it.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Good choice.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. Thanks.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>I'm going to show you a picture now. Would you describe what you see here?</A>
<B>O K. This is a ski resort.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ur</F> <laughter>everyone's</laughter> playing in the snow. They're skiers and kids playing the snowballs. There's a kid being hit in the face with a snowball. And one guy's falling down on the skies, and he's <?>just</?> a little bit buried in the snow. And <F>mm</F> it looks like they're all having a good time. Also, <F>mm</F> <SC>there's</SC> yeah, <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> just today, we were talking about, <F>ur</F> one of my friends from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> like snow, and I don't. We're both from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And I don't. It's too cold and annoying. <nvs>laughter</nvs> It's hard to drive in. So I'm looking forward to no snow in this winter in Japan. <F>Mm</F>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. All right. So you're from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, and it's cold there.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>How do you usually spend your time when you're back home</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>.</B>
<A>during the winter?</A>
<B>Watching a lot of movies mostly. <F>Ur</F> <R>just</R> <F>uh</F> just today, <R>my</R> my friend <H pn="others7">XXX10</H> who's from <H pn="others8">XXX11</H>, she came in <??></??> to class wearing five or six layers of coat, shirt, sweatshirt, and just saying <R>how</R> how cold it was. And I was wearing an under shirt and that's all. And I'm like it's really not bad today at all.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And <SC>I had</SC> <F>um</F> <R>I</R> I thought that I'd put a head <?>arm</?>, but I took it off because I was too warm. And she thought I was crazy. So <SC>it is very</SC> it is generally cold in the winter, and we've watched a lot of movies, play a lot of video games, <laughter>mostly</laughter> stuff you can do inside. Go to a movie theater or rent movies. It's much cheaper in America so you can rent a lot of movies, or go see movies four times a week, and it's really not that bad.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A>I see. O K. So <F>ur</F> do you yourself ski?</A>
<B>No, <SC>I actually</SC> I've never been skiing because while we get a lot of snow, it's very flat.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <SC>unless</SC> <F>ur</F> the only people who are doing skiing is with their family took them on ski trips to other areas of America. And my family, <SC>just</SC> <F>eh</F> since they had never skied, they don't take us. So really it's if your family skies, then they would have taken you. I know some people who had gone, but it's really nothing nearby. You have to go quite a ways, often in airplane to go fly out west to go skiing. I haven't done it. I have been cross-country skiing and that's where you ski in flat ground. But it's not really fun. It's more of a workout because you just have to move your legs yourself the whole time. And it's one of the most difficult exercises, I think.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. O K. Actually, if you can remember, can you tell me about the last time you went cross country skiing?</A>
<B>Yes. <R>I</R> <laughter><SC>I</SC> it was a</laughter> long time ago actually. It was in eighth grade when I was in junior high. There was a one week trip where we went to <F>ur</F> the state above us, <F>ur</F> to <SC><H pn="others9">XXX12</H></SC>, <F>ur</F> no, <H pn="others10">XXX13</H> because they have even more snow than us, and it's colder. And <SC>we</SC> only a small portion of our eighth grade could go, and everybody signed up. And I remember I was a last person whose name was picked. So I was very close to not going. And it ended up being really fun because <SC>it was not</SC> <F>uh</F> there is summer camp, but I had never gone so it's one of the first times I was away from my parents for a very long period for a week, just with my friends. And <F>ur</F> me and my junior high friends are good friends. And we went there, and we went cross country skiing, and walked on snow shoes which are like tennis rackets you walk on.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Ur</F> and I remember <F>ur</F> the food there was really bad. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But it was funny because we laughed about it. <CO>And</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> yeah.</B>
<A>O K. Thanks.</A>
<B>Sure.</B> 
</followup>
<task>
<A>Another picture.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Describe this <?>what's in</?>.</A>
<B>O K. This is an electronic store. And it's three o'clock</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>in the afternoon. And there's <nvs>laughter</nvs> many different sizes of stereo systems offered. And the customer is asking a question of the <F>ur</F> clerk. And the clerk is pointing at the watches, I believe. So maybe it's a question about watches. There's an extremely large T V and a smaller T V. And there's large C D players, small C D player and telephones for sale. Also cameras. <.></.> More? <F>Hm</F>?</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>O K?</B>
<A>Fine.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So have you done any shopping in <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>?</A>
<B>Yes. But <F>ur</F> living at all cost so much that I don't buy anything.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>I know that I</SC> <F>uh</F> <SC>all summer, I worked <SC>full hour</SC> <F>um</F> full time</SC> I worked forty-five hours a week every week all summer just to save money to come here. But I knew that if I came here and bought things, then I would run out of the money very quickly. So now, I do spend a lot of money, and I don't ever hold back. If we go out, I would spend as much money as possible. And sometimes <F>ur</F> even a hundred dollars a weekend. But I don't buy things because that would really send me back. But I'd like to go shopping and look <F>ur</F> especially at electronic stores because <R>I'm a</R> I'm a computer science major</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>in America. And I really like, <F>ur</F> I mentioned before video games and movies and <F>ur</F> computers. So I like to go to Akihabara,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and just walk around and look at things. But</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B>I never buy anything. <SC>I have</SC> <F>ur</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> because <R>even</R> even though if a electronic's made in Japan, sometimes <R>it</R> <R>it</R> it isn't cheaper in Japan.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Just people say, "<F>Oh</F> you can buy really cheap electronics in Japan.". But actually no.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>It's not any cheaper. It might be better,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>but it's not cheaper.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><SC>So</SC> <F>um</F> and then lots of times <F>uh</F> my <F>uh</F> girlfriends wanted to go shopping. And I just <F>um</F> go with,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><SC>and</SC> but I don't buy anything.</B>
<A>Right.</A>

<A>Now, we're going to do some role-plays.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>And I'll give you a card, and if you can read it. So we just talk <??></??>.</A>
<B>Sure.</B>
<A>O K?</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<A>Ready?</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. May I help you, sir?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> listen. I need to get to New York.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And I need to get there really fast.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So can you tell me when the next train is coming? If I can buy a ticket now, <F>ur</F> if it would be cheaper for make a reservation on the phone, <F>ur</F> <F>well</F> how many tickets are available, what classes, and if possible, the train that comes after that?</B>
<A>O K. First of all, you asked me how often trains are available. But there're many types.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>So</OL> I need to know</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A><?>your</?>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I suppose <F>ur</F> the cheapest train, actually, would do fine for me.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Well</F> there are two cheap trains.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. O K. <F>Ur</F> what is difference between the trains?</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> just whether there is a food <F>um</F> court or not <OL>inside</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>. O K. <F>Well</F> I didn't bring any food with me so the food train sounds pretty good.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> when is that train leaving?</B>
<A>It's leaving in fifteen minutes.</A>
<B>Fifteen minutes. That's excellent. Can I buy my ticket right now?</B>
<A>Sure.</A>

<followup>
<A>All right. So have you traveled much in Japan?</A>
<B>In Japan, not really. <F>Ur</F> again, it's kind of a money issue.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>People keep asking, "<F>Oh</F> <SC>do you</SC> <SC>are you planning</SC> are you going to Kyoto or Osaka?". I say, "No.". <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>I can go play</SC> because I figure there's enough places I can get to <F>um</F> nearby, and see things that <SC>I don't really</SC> it really would cost a lot to spend a weekend trip. Staying over night especially. <F>Ur</F> again, <R>I</R> I don't mind spending money, but paying for hotel and <JP>shinkansen</JP> and everything would really eat up, so I haven't gone anywhere far. But I try <F>eh</F> to go everywhere around <H pn="others5">XXX08</H> area. <SC>And</SC> but at this point, I've actually been everywhere I wanted to go. So maybe traveling somewhere else might be a good idea.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But I've been repeating areas I've liked</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>in the past, though.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. Such as?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. <F>Well</F> Shibuya. <F>Ur</F> I went to a couple of <F>er</F> nightspots. And I thought that was most fun. <CO>And</CO>. <F>Er</F>.</B>
<A>O K. We're <??></??>.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <OL>sure</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Erm</F></OL> so you mentioned <SC>your</SC> you need to save money.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> so other than not buying things, how do you <OL>save money</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Huh</F></OL>. <F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> one of my first things, in the first couple of weeks,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I used the vending machines a lot. <SC>It</SC> <SC>i</SC> this is just something little. But everyday I would generally buy a drink from the vending machine. And I just said if I just carry water in my back pack, and don't buy a drink everyday for a hundred twenty yen,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>I</SC> after three months, that would probably save me some money. <SC>And</SC> so <SC>I try and to do</SC> the things aren't really necessary, I try not to do. And also in the beginning, I bought a lot of ice cream. Just I'd see ice cream, and I just buy it.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So now <SC>I</SC> <laughter><F>ur</F></laughter> so I try to do that. Also, if possible, on the trains the cheapest ride possible.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Again, I don't wanna be cheap, but I will run out of money if I don't. But <SC>then I also</SC> <F>ur</F> I could have gotten some part-time English teaching job. I know some students every weekend or once a week go somewhere.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And they make money helping with English. I think I should have done that, but I was too lazy. And also it would <F>ur</F> cut into my free time which I value so much. But then I want something comes up where I can make some money doing something <?>at once</?>, <F>ur</F> then</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I'd like to.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>

<B>O K.</B>
<A>So ring-ring. Hello, This is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>.</A>
<B>Hi. <F>Ur</F> this is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. We're thinking about going to see "The Ring" tonight.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> have you heard of it?</B>
<A>No.</A>
<B>O K. It's just a new movie. It came out in America while ago.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>It's supposed to be pretty scary. <F>Ur</F> <R>I</R> I honestly don't know what's it about, but it's supposed to be pretty cool. It's only rated P G thirteen</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>so it might not be gory. But it might still be scary from what I hear.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> now me and Zack are going. No one else wanted to come. And <F>ur</F> we were wondering though we don't have a car. Can you drive?</B>

<B><F>Ur</F> you're working <OL>today</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. <F>Urm</F> O K. If you really wanna see the movie, we could go tomorrow. But if you don't care, we're just gonna go tonight without you. What do you think?</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> no, I'd really like to go.</A>
<B>You would?</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>.</A>

<A>O K. That's the end of this one. All right. So <F>urm</F> you're gonna go watch "The Ring" for real? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Yes, yes</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. <F>Urm</F> actually, the original movie was made in Japan.</A>
<B>I just heard that.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> and I also heard it wasn't made that long ago, either. Nineteen ninety-eight?</B>
<A>Or so.</A>
<B>Did you see it?</B>
<A>No. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>No, O K</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I'm very curious.</B>
<A>Have you seen any Japanese movies <OL>recently</OL>?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <OL><R>unfor</R></OL> <F>um</F> unfortunately, <F>er</F> we don't get many foreign movies at all in <H pn="others9">XXX12</H>. And if we do get a Japanese movie, it's gonna be <JP>anime</JP>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And there aren't that many Japanese movies in the first place <F>ur</F> compared to America.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>But <F>ur</F> the only one that I know was released in America as an actual movie was "Shall We Dance?"</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I know that one is popular internationally. I thought that was cute, more of a girl movie, but it was pretty funny. <F>Ur</F>.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>So from your impression from that movie, <F>ur</F> could you make a comparison between like American movies and Japanese movies?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> that was only one I saw. I could do better to comparing American animation to Japanese <OL>animation</OL></B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B>since <SC>I've seen</SC> yeah, I've seen plenty of <R>a</R> <JP>anime</JP> because that does come over.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> in general, I think the main difference is America only makes <F>ur</F> animation for children, and <R>it can't</R> <F>ur</F> it can't ever convince yourself that a movie might be for older people. And I know that Japan <F>ur</F> <SC>has</SC> they <F>well</F> use animation to make any sort of movie than Americans might make. I could just be something that just a drama or absolutely no fighting and just people talking. And it would be animated. America doesn't really ever do anything like that. It would only be comedy or for children in general. And it's kind of looked-down upon. <F>Ur</F> you can say, "<F>Oh</F> I like kids movies, and I like to watch them sometimes.". But actually, really liking cartoons in America is sort of considered childish. I know that at least, even on the trains I see, grown men all the time reading comics which I think is nice because they are made for older men and children, there's different kinds. So I'd say <SC>that's</SC> the main difference is that <F>mm</F> they <F>ur</F> use <SC>it</SC> <F>er</F> the medium <SC>to</SC> for any sort of area,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>not just one.</B>

<A>O K. Now the last role-play is this one. O K?</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B><F>Mm</F>. O K. I <F>er</F> was thinking about moving into an apartment. I wanna get out of my parents' house.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I just graduated, and they drive me crazy. So I would like to stay in the <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> area, though. And <F>ur</F> so <SC>something</SC> somewhere nearby is good. And <F>ur</F> I was wondering what you <F>ur</F> have available that is in the medium price range. And <SC>if</SC> also <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> <R>how ma</R> <F>uh</F> how many people the apartment is for, if there's one or two or something like that.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> we have two or three <F>urm</F> medium-priced places right in the city.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. O K. <SC>In the city</SC> O K, <SC>the city</SC> <F>ur</F> now, that would be <R>with</R> with traffic and all, <SC>I don't know what</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>I would</SC> I prefer to live a little bit outside <F>ur</F> as well. Do you have anything maybe <SC>two</SC> <F>ur</F> half hour or so from the main area?</B>
<A>Yeah. <F>Urm</F> sure. We have more actually</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>in the suburbs.</A>
<B>Yeah. And it's probably a little cheaper.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>That's good. <F>Mm</F>. Now <F>ur</F> also, something in the nice neighborhood would be good. <F>Ur</F> one of the <laughter>yeah</laughter> lower crime rate neighborhoods.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>Because I get worried about some neighborhoods sometimes.</B>
<A>Right, right.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> that kind of depends on your budget.</A>
<B>That's true. I just started working so it seems to me like I have a lot of money, but I'm not sure yet. I'm also making payments for my new car. So I have to think about that. Maybe if you get me a list of prices, I can consider and look over it and call you back tomorrow.</B>
<A>Sure. But <F>ur</F> it's a busy season <OL>now</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>So you might wanna look around today.</A>
<B><F>Ohh</F> that's true. That's true. Is there anything nearby <SC>you could</SC> <SC>you would</SC> <R>can I</R> can I look at the apartments first? Can we go to them? <OL>Of course</OL>?</B>
<A><OL>Of course, sure</OL>.</A>
<B>O K. And <F>ur</F> are there people living in them now, or they're currently empty waiting for the first person?</B>
<A>People are in there now.</A>

<B>And <SC>they're wai</SC> <F>oh</F> yeah, they're waiting for somebody to <OL>talk to</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B>O K. Yeah. Then maybe we should go around and take a look at a few closer ones.</B>
<A>O K. So <F>um</F> I'll ring some people up, and we can go in like ten minutes.</A>
<B>O K. <OL>Thank you very much</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. Thanks.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Er</F> so when you go back, do you plan to live alone?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> the thing is <F>well</F> the most interesting thing is I've always lived with my brother.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>We shared a room. I've never had my own room. I've always shared the room with my brother. Then I got to college, and I had a roommate at college. <SC>And</SC> but now, my sister is getting married.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So she's moving out of the house within a month. So when I go home, I'll actually have my own room.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So living at home <F>well</F> actually seem better for me because it'll be seen a lot different because I have my own room now. I think a big reason I don't like living at home is because I have to share my room. So <SC>I never really s</SC> it never seems like I really like being there. If I have my own room where I can spend time, I think it'll be better because I can invite friends over. We can hang out in my room because often if they come over, then my brother would come in. And it would be no fun. It would be kind of awkward. <laughter>So</laughter> <F>ur</F> I think I will definitely stay at home for a while. And it's just winter break <F>ur</F> for couple of weeks uhtil I go back to school. But <F>um</F> <SC>hopefully</SC> I've been living alone now in Japan so I've just started. So I'm kind of used to it now. So hopefully when I go back to school, maybe I can find a single.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Also all of my friends at school already have roommates. Because I left America, <F>er</F> <SC>they all found</SC> <SC>they fou</SC> <SC?>he</SC?> my roommate found a new roommate. So if I go, I don't know, I don't want to room with a stranger.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>I see. O K. <F>Urm</F> you mentioned your sister. Can you tell me more about her?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Ur</F> my sister, she's twenty-two. It's very young to get married. I'm twenty. I have no intention of getting married at twenty-two. <SC>She</SC> we went to the same university.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But <SC>I was</SC> I never really much liked her. She was always very mean to me and the family. And I don't think she's very nice. So we never hung out. Lots of times, I would know people at my school</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>for months. And <F>ur</F> then I mentioned my sister like goes to the school, and they would be shocked. "You have a sister here? Why don't you ever talk about her?" I'm like, "I don't like her.". So she's getting married, and that's good because all she does is fight with people at home. If I go home, we can't even have dinner. She usually starts an argument. So <F>ur</F> her wedding is actually next month. I have to go back to America for her wedding. It's <F>mm</F> very inconvenient. But I think it's a very happy occasion for everyone because my mom's happy she's getting married. I'm happy she's leaving. <F>Urm</F> <laughter>yeah</laughter> I get her room.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I have to fly back to America for a couple of days. But also, it's right after Thanksgiving. <F>Ur</F> and I'm glad I can go home for that American holiday. So I'll actually get home on Thanksgiving, and eat with the family then. After that, have the wedding.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><laughter>And then</laughter> come back to Japan. And <F>ur</F> then when I go home for Christmas, she'll be gone, and I get her room. So that's good. <SC>She</SC> I think <R>it's</R> it's good that she's getting married though, because <F>ur</F> she doesn't really do much, and she doesn't have many friends so it's probably better for her to be married. But I would feel <SC?>it would</SC?> <F>um</F> <SC>since I'm</SC> <SC>I</SC> it'll take away for my <F>ur</F> young, carefree <laughter>life style</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>So I think it's a good idea for everyone that she's getting married. But definitely a little young.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>
<A>O K. All right. <F>Urm</F> <.></.> yeah, so you're going back home next month.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> how do you plan to arrange your trip, like how are you gonna find your ticket back?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> I was very lucky because I knew <H pn="others11">XXX14</H> who was just in here.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <H pn="others11">XXX14</H> and I went to the same university in America. And we did not know each other. But we were both coming on this program. So we met and said, "<F>Oh</F> I'm <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. We're going to Japan together.". And she said, "<F>Oh</F> O K.". And she said her aunt is a travel agent, and she said her aunt can buy us tickets for us. And I thought that was really convenient because it's not very easy <SC>in</SC> <F>ur</F> to find cheap tickets. So her aunt bought us tickets, a round trip to come here and to go home in December.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Then for my trip home <SC>and</SC> <F>er</F> for my sister's wedding, I told my father, I said, <F>um</F> "I don't really want to come home from Japan. So if you want me to come home, you can pay for my ticket and buy it and send it to me because I don't care.". <nvs>laughter</nvs> Because he at first were like <F>oh</F> look for some tickets, all right. And I said, "No.". <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>So my dad <F>ur</F> just bought the ticket, and he mailed it to me. So luckily, I did not have to do anything.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. <OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><CO>But <F>ur</F></CO></OL>. Yes. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>

<A><F>Er</F> let's try this one.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K? So the pictures go this way. <F>Oops</F> sorry.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And</OL> <F>er</F> this happened before so please start the story with, "One day last week".</A>
<B>O K. One day last week, <F>ur</F> Bob and Suzie were walking home from the restaurant. And it was raining out. It was raining pretty hard. They both had their umbrellas out. And they were having a conversation. But Bob heard a noise. He sounded a little bit like a dog. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Eh</F> but he wasn't sure what it was at first. And he stopped. And Suzie said, "What is it? What do you hear?". He said, "I think there's something over there.". And in the cardboard box sitting next to a building was this little puppy. And since it was raining, the box is all soaking wet, and dog was shivering. And it was very cold, and he just <SC>c</SC> look completely abandoned. There was no one nearby. And it <SC>does</SC> didn't look like there was a mother dog or anything. It <R>o</R> obviously looked like somebody just put the dog in this box. And Suzie instantly picked up the dog, and started saying how cute it was. Bob said, "I don't think our apartment has any room for a dog.". And Suzie said, "<F>Well</F> they allow pets in our apartment. And the most apartments, they don't. So we're lucky we can have a dog. And we should help him by bringing it back.". And Bob was still not too sure because he knew that raising it would cost money. And especially they found that on the street, they would have to take it to the vet and have it get shots, and make sure it's healthy, and buy specially puppy food. And it would just be a pain in a butt. But she <SC>was</SC> pretty much <F>ur</F> didn't listen to him at all, and picked up the dog and said, "We're taking this dog home. And if you don't let me, I'm not gonna kiss you tonight.". And Bob said, "<F>Oh</F> <F>well</F> O K. Let's bring the dog home, Suzie.". And they took the dog home. And Suzie is planning on keeping the dog, but Bob still hopes to give it to someone else pretty soon.</B>

<A>So you said you have a girlfriend.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And</OL> <SC>could you</SC> if you don't mind, could you tell me about your last date?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yeah. Sure. That's no problem. <F>Um</F> <F>well</F> <SC>last time</SC> we usually go out alone because <R>her</R> <SC>her</SC> <F>uh</F> most of the Japanese girls we know are English majors, but she is actually a Chinese major. So <SC>she di</SC> <SC>she</SC> like all Japanese students, she learned English from sixth grade to twelfth grade, I think. So she knows it. But she's not studying it, and that's not what she cares about. <F>Um</F> <SC>so</SC> <F>ur</F> and also, she's not that good at it. <nvs>laughter</nvs> She's O K. We can communicate. So usually when we're together, I'll speak Japanese, and she'll speak some English, too. <SC>But then if we go out with other Ame</SC> because most of my <SC>frien</SC> <F>uh</F> male friends are Americans. So if we're with them, she feels very left out. And she never really understands what we're saying to each other. So normally she doesn't come with us. <F>Ur</F> but last time we went out, we did. <F>Ur</F> I was talking to her, and she got off her work. And <SC>she wanted to</SC> <F>uh</F> we wanted to see each other. And <SC>we bo</SC> we didn't have many ideas because we've been doing a lot of stuff recently. And she remembered that I said I like bowling. And there's a bowling alley near her house, and she didn't want to go far. But going bowling with two people can be kind of boring. So my friend <H pn="others12">XXX15</H> who is in the dorm with me, I mentioned him before. <F>Ur</F> it's convenient because we live together, and I said, "<H pn="others12">XXX15</H>, let's go bowling.". He said, "O K.". Again, so we had nothing to do. <R>We don't have</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> you know, we don't have to tell anyone where we're going. So me and him went. And then she called one of her Japanese friends who lives near her house. So the four of us went bowling together. And ended up it was a lot of fun. Because when me and <H pn="others12">XXX15</H> were talking, <F>ur</F> <H pn="others13">XXX16</H> and <H pn="others14">XXX17</H> could talk. And then also we could all talk amongst ourselves. But then nobody felt left out. And with four people, it's much more fun bowling. The problem is <F>ur</F> the girls beat us. They <OL>had a higher score</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>And for a long time, I was not too happy about that. <SC>Be</SC> <R>it's not</R> it's not <F>ur</F> exactly a male issue because if a girl beats me in some things, I don't mind. Like if I play badminton, <SC>that's</SC> <SC?>and then</SC?> and I lose, that's O K. But I was on a bowling team</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>in high school. So I care about bowling a lot. But when you bowl, if you don't bowl often, you just forget how and <SC>you don't</SC> you get worse. So if you used to be good, you can very easily start being bad again. You don't keep being good at bowling. So in my brain, I'm a good bowler. But I actually stink. So I don't bowl very often. So I want to be good, and I remember being very good. So then I bowl and I'm not very good, and it makes me <laughter>very</laughter> upset. And she could tell I was kind of mad. <nvs>laughter</nvs> I was. I admit it. But it was also because I was bowling bad, and my girlfriend was beating me. It's kind of both. But eventually, <F>um</F> it was O K, and I got over it. I beat <H pn="others12">XXX15</H> so that helped.</B>
<A>I can <laughter>understand</laughter>.</A>

And his dad was retired already so he had time to <F>ur</F> do whatever he wished. And Bob suggested that they go out to a restaurant and catch up on things. So <F>ur</F> the dad <SC?>wa</SC?> and Bob both agreed on this one restaurant that they've heard about but haven't been to yet. So they decided to try it out. They go in together, and they see an open table <SC>and they</SC> by the window, and they like to sit by the window so they can see people passing by. So they go down and sit. And they <SC>ord</SC> check out the menu, and they order some food and alcohol. Bob has some beer, and his dad has some wine. And they both have some meats. Afterwards, <F>ur</F> his dad pays for the bill which is half the reason Bob wanted to go out with his dad anyway because he knew it would be a free meal. And they were both full and a little bit drunk. And then Bob decided to go see his girlfriend, and <SC>sa</SC> tell his dad good-bye. And they said good-bye.</B>

<followup>
<A>O K. All right. So <F>urm</F> what's your favorite restaurant like in <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>?</A>
<B>In <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>?</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I think my favorite restaurant here <SC>would be T</SC> is Tenya. <F>Ur</F> because <F>ur</F> we don't have food like that in America. There's other restaurants here I enjoy, but I can usually get that food in America, too. <SC>I</SC> there's two reasons I like Tenya. They really only have one food. <F>Ur</F> you can get tempura. <SC>That</SC> I think that's <F>mm</F> pretty much all they sell. <F>Urm</F> but <R>I li</R> I like it a lot. And <R>when you get</R> when you get tempura in a cafeteria and the dormitory, it's not very good. <SC><laughter>And that's</laughter> excellent</SC>. <F>Er</F> and <R>two</R> <F>ur</F> two things, tempura <R>i</R> is delicious. And I think putting the sauce and rice tastes very good. And usually, Japanese people never put sauce on the white rice. But at Tenya, they have a bowl of rice with the tempura on top. And they pour the stuff over it. So the rice has sauce in it. So I can eat sauce rice without getting weird looks. Because often in my cafeteria, if I ever put anything on my rice, I can really tell the Japanese men look at me, and they think I'm insane. So it's a good excuse to get some delicious rice and delicious tempura. And it's not very expensive. And it's also <SC>very</SC> <F>ur</F> near the station so it's convenient. <R>I</R> I usually go there most often.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. O K. <F>Urm</F> when you walk into a Japanese restaurant and you're not quite sure of <F>um</F> the dishes,</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>how do you decide what to order?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>uh</F> <R>it's</R> it's really useful when they do have the window out front that shows what food they have. If not that, then usually I'm with a Japanese person, and I can ask them. But I am studying Japanese, and I can read Japanese <laughter>so <F>er</F></laughter> if necessary, I read the menu. But even if I can read what it says, <F>ur</F> I might not know what the food is. And again, if I'm with a Japanese person, I usually just ask them. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>That's mainly</SC> <F>ur</F> <F>er</F> just by looking and asking, trying figure out what there is. And then remembering for the next time.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. I see. O K.</A>

<A><F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> we're almost finishing up.</A>

<A>Yeah. And <.></.> any plans to have something nice tonight?</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> tonight. Tonight, there's not much going on. Right after this, I have to go study for my history mid-term.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> everyone else in the class has already started. And I said I would come after this which is good, it's O K because they'll have all the answers. And I can go and be like, "<F>Oh</F> I'm sorry. I'm late but I had to go to that thing. So can I see all your answers?". <OL><SC>And</OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>then</SC> and <R>they</R> <SC>they won't</SC> if I showed up, and I had no reason for being late, they might feel weird about it. But they know I wanted to come. So it's a good excuse. Then after that, the movie with <H pn="others12">XXX15</H>.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>Then we will return home together. And eat food in the cafeteria together because it's free cafeteria food.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>urm</F> tomorrow night, I'm doing something with my girlfriend. I don't know. After she gets off work. I don't really know what yet. Saturday, karaoke with some other people. We're planning to go all night actually because usually if I go for two hours, it just doesn't seem like enough. So we just wanna rent a room for all night. And get really drunk</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and sing. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> What's your favorite song now?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <laughter><SC>I've been</SC></laughter> <F>oh</F> <F>ur</F> I don't know many Japanese songs. But I've been here long enough.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>er</F> the popular ones, I hear them in stores so often. And <SC>I</SC> we've been to karaoke enough. Usually, they pick the same songs to sing. And one song I definitely like is <F>ur</F> "Okina Furudokei,"</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><R>the</R> the old clock song. And I can sing it now. <SC>If</SC> I heard it enough so that if I see the words in Japanese, I can sing along. Because I might be able to read the Japanese, but if I don't know the song, there's no way you can sing along. It's too fast. But I've heard it enough now. I can get by, and it usually impresses the Japanese people if I can sing a Japanese song. So I'd like to do that. It's an excellent song, too.</B>
