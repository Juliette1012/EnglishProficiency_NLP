<stage1>
<A>Hello. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have your name, please?</A>
<B>My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>Nice to meet <OL>you</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Nice to</OL> meet you. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> So <F>um</F> are you a student here?</A>
<B>Yes, I am.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. What do you study?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I'm studying Japanese, mainly.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I'm also taking arts and society, <F>erm</F> the history of Tokyo. And <F>um</F> every Wednesday, I have a field placement in an elementary school.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So every Tuesday, we have <F>um</F> social organization class to talk about things that happen every Wednesday.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. I see. Can you tell me about that elementary school?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> it's a school that was built in <SC>ninety-ninety</SC> nineteen ninety-nine. <F>Um</F> there are about eight hundred students. <F>Um</F> the philosophy of the school is community, so they have three-wall-classrooms.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So it can get very noisy</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>at times</OL>. <F>Um</F> <SC>I'm</SC> <R>my</R> my main purpose there is to help teach English.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So just for correct pronunciations and clarification for the teachers and the students. So <F>erm</F> I usually eat lunch with the kids. <F>Um</F> I sometimes <?>aid</?> the teachers. And I just try to observe as much as I can while participating.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. So do you like it there?</A>
<B>I like it there. <OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>It's definitely interesting because I wanna teach elementary school eventually.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So this is very good practice for me.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I see. <F>Um</F> what are some difficulties that you face when you are there, if any?</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>. <nvs>sigh</nvs> I think a lot of the difficulties <F>uh</F> are the cultural differences.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> because I know with Japanese schools, <F>um</F> a lot of times you just do what you are told and you don't really question the teacher. And I like to give kids choices.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So sometimes when I give the kids choices, like what they wanna do, they look at me like, "Is it O K if we can choose or you're just going to tell up what we're gonna do?". <F>Erm</F> <SC>so</SC> and also the language is tough sometimes. <F>Um</F> I'm supposed to speak English to the children, but I try to speak Japanese during lunch with the teachers.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And sometimes they look at me like they think I know what I'm talking about, but other times they don't. And I get frustrated because they don't understand. <SC>So</SC> but it goes both ways.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I see.</A>
<B>But I do have a lot of ideas that I want to take back to the States <F>um</F> when <?>the students</?> teach in the spring.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. O K. <R>So</R> so you came here to learn Japanese and to learn about Japan. Why are you interested?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> my grandma is Japanese.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>So it hasn't been a big part of my upbringing. But I've always wanted to learn more about it.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> and try to learn to speak the language.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> so that's the main reason why I chose Japan.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>And I wanted somewhere different.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Because a lot of people from my school go to London and Paris and Madrid and I didn't wanna go to a main stream city so much.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Um</F> so what's your grandma like?</A>
<B>She's eighty-one. And she is the cutest person that I know of. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><F>Um</F> she's just very funny and very lively.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And she has so many stories from her upbringing.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And a lot of them are hard for her to talk about <F>um</F> because she hasn't been in Japan over thirty years.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>um</F> she's told me stories about the war when she was in Nagasaki when the bomb was dropped. And I don't wanna push her.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But I also wanna know. So I can't really come right out and ask her</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>um</F> direct questions.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. When you see her, what do you do together?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <.></.> <F>well</F> she's always been there. <SC>So</SC> <F>uh</F> I mean in America. <SC>So</SC> <F>um</F> but when I see her, I just say, "<R>Hi</R> hi, Grandma," and she's all "Hi, Shay.". <nvs>laughter</nvs> <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Uh</F> so you live together?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> she lives about twenty minutes away.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>But she's always been <R>in</R></B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>in my town.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So she's always been there.</B>
<A>And where is your hometown?</A>
<B>In <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. O K. I've never been there. <OL>What's it like</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Um</F> it's nice. It's a very industrial city. <F>Um</F> I think there's about a million people total.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So it's a very communal place to live. There are a lot of different things to do. <F>Um</F> there's a lot of art galleries and museums and sports venues.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> so it's a very nice place to live and to visit. But I didn't wanna go to college there. I needed somewhere completely different.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I didn't wanna be at a big city and I didn't wanna be at a big school. So <F>um</F> <F>er</F> both of the main colleges in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> are pretty big.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I chose to go elsewhere.</B>
<A>I see. O K. <F>Um</F> all right.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>So we're going to move on.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K? And I'll show you a picture.</A>
<B><nvs>cough</nvs></B>
<A>If you could describe what you see here.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Oh</F> this looks like the side of a mountain. <F>Erm</F> probably a very touristy area. <F>Um</F> there is <.></.> probably a ski lodge. And there's two people having coffee talking, a male and a female. <F>Um</F> and outside, there is a snowman and skis and, <F>oh</F> what was that called, <SC>s</SC> a snowboard. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Um</F> there's also people having a snowball fight. <F>Um</F> and one child is getting hit with the snowball. <F>Um</F> there are people skiing down the mountain, although it looks like they just skied off the top of the roof just by the way their position in the picture. <F>Um</F> there's one person who fell off <.></.> the skis. There's one person snowboarding. And it looks like, at the bottom right-hand corner, there's four people who are gonna talk about something, because it seems like they're coming together.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Um</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> it snows a lot in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> <OL>also</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yes. It already has <OL>like <?>there</?></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL> really?</A>
<B>Yeah. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Um</F> what do you usually do in the wintertime?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <nvs>sigh</nvs> <.></.> I usually go sledding with my friends and my younger siblings. <F>Erm</F> sometimes we build snowmen. <F>Um</F> in January, we usually get about four and a half feet just in one month. So the snow never melts. So <laughter>it's always</laughter> there. So <F>um</F> we build igloos once in a while and go for hikes in the woods. <F>Um</F> <.></.> so <R>I've</R> I've gotten used to it. So right now in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>, it's not that cold for me. But I like snow and I miss it <OL>actually</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>. I see. O K. <F>Um</F> <.></.> <F>hm</F>. Can you tell me about something that you did with your sister <F>um</F> before you came to Japan?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>Did you spend time with her at all?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>well</F> she's six.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So before I left, I asked her what she wanted to do, because she wouldn't see me for four months. And she said that she wanted to dress up like me. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>So <F>um</F> I dressed her in some of my clothes and I did her hair and a little bit of makeup and some nail polish.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>um</F> she wanted to go shopping together. So we went out for a little while. And my whole family had gone to see a movie. So <F>um</F> we're pretty close.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>And when I look at her, <SC>I see her when</SC> I see myself</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>when she was my age.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>So</OL> <R>she's</R> she's something else. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. I see. O K.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>Now, the <OL>next picture</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL></B>
<A>Once again, if you could describe what you see.</A>
<B>This looks like part of a department store and is the electronic section. <F>Erm</F> there are a few T Vs for sale. Underneath that, there are some camcorders and cameras, possibly one is a digital camera. This is a salesman talking to a customer who looks like he's interested in buying a watch. And there are some C D players and stereos for sale. And <SC>it doesn't</SC> there are no other customers around. And it's three o'clock.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Erm</F> have you shopped at department stores here?</A>
<B>I haven't, actually.</B>
<A>No?</A>
<B>I've actually tried to stay away from department stores</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>and go toward</OL> smaller stores, more family owned</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>stores.</B>
<A>Why is that?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I don't like big crowds. So that's why I sort of stay away from department stores. And smaller stores usually have more interesting things for sale. And they are more hand made and unique versus a main stream item.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I see. What are some differences in shopping in Japan and in the States?</A>
<B>One of the biggest things that I've noticed is in America, if you're in an aisle and if you're walking down the aisle and there's someone in your way, they usually move to get out of the way.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>But in the <laughter>Japanese</laughter> stores, they just seem to stay in that one place and you sort of have to go around them even if there's someone else coming.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So there can sort of be <SC>one</SC> three people in one aisle and it can get a little congested and a little frustrating. Because even if you say, "Excuse me," sometimes they still don't move.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I'm not sure whether it's because I'm American or they just don't wanna move.</B>
<A><OL><laughter><F>Mh-hmm</F></laughter></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> So that's the biggest difference that I've noticed. But the salespeople are very nice.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And they sort of greet you when you come in. And say thank you <.></.> a lot.</B>
<A>Right. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> Yeah</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>A lot</OL>. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. <F>Hm</F>. O K. Thanks.</A>
</followup>
</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A><F>Um</F> now, we're going to do some role-plays.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>? I'll give you a card. And if you could read it. <R>And</R> and let me know when you are ready.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>All right. May I help you?</A>
<B>Yes. I'm looking for a one-bedroom apartment.</B>
<A>O K. We have several.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Erm</F> I would prefer the view to be <SC>looking</SC> overlooking a river of some sort. <F>Um</F> I would prefer it to not be near a subway line, <?>so</?> it's noisy. <F>Erm</F> and I also have a dog. So I'm wondering if you can help me find one <F>er</F> that allows pets to live there</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>as well</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Oh</F> there are only a few places that allow pets now that I know of.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Um</F> <.></.> do you know what the utilities are like? <CO>Or will <SC>it come</SC> <F>uh</F> the apartments come with furniture wise or</CO>?</B>
<A><F>Well</F> one is furnished.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K? But it doesn't come with heat or water. You have to pay it separately. But the other one is the opposite.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>It's unfurnished but <SC>it's</SC> <F>er</F></A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>all the utilities are there.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Um</F> do you know what the areas are like? <SC>Are they</SC> <F>erm</F> they have a lot of families or <SC>is it</SC> what age group the people usually tend to live <OL>in</OL>?</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. One is near a university,</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>so it's</OL> a young crowd.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>And the other one is more for business people but it's mainly for single</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>people. Yeah.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Erm</F> do you know if there's any families in the <SC>area</SC> <F>uh</F> areas or is it mainly college students and business people?</B>
<A><F>Well</F> there are houses around <OL>the</OL> apartment buildings.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>. O K.</B>
<A>O K. So are you interested in seeing <SC>some of them</SC></A>
<B><OL>I think I am</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Er</F> the</OL> two of them?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>So <F>er</F></OL> I'll make an appointment.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Thank you</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>All right</OL>. Thanks. So that's the end of this role-play.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So <F>um</F> in the States, are you living alone?</A>
<B>No, I live with my family.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><R>At</R> at home.</B>
<A>At home. <OL><F>Huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Um</F> <.></.> how do you think it's different, living alone and living with family?</A>
<B>My house at home is very busy. <F>Erm</F> there are six people in my family. So there's always something going on. <F>Erm</F> so I sort of gotten used to the hustle and bustle of everyday life and getting up early <F>erm</F> with my <?>older</?> brother and sister who are six and eight, and I have another brother who is sixteen.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>erm</F> I'm just used to <SC>ha</SC> hearing the <??></??> six in the morning and them jumping in the bed with me and <F>um</F> just being able to cuddle with them on the couch and looking up to breakfast.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> but here, I live alone in a one-room apartment basically. So, you know, there's no one around, no one to wake up to, I always have to make breakfast.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><laughter>So</laughter></OL> <F>mm</F> sometimes that could be a burden. But <F>erm</F> I sort of like being independent, so I think that I like living alone. But I also miss <.></.> the company at home. I sort of want both at the same time.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But I can't have it.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><SC>So</SC> but at home, you know, I have my own room and a sort of my space. And I ask my family that whenever the door is shut to please knock if they wanna come in. And that's just a general rule for the house basically.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. I see. O K.</A>

</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. So what do you usually do with your friends here?</A>
<B><nvs>sigh</nvs> <F>Well</F> it's a lot harder to go out with people here because we all live so far apart.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>So <R>always</R> always have to take the train and meet at a station. And it takes so long to get to <laughter>different <OL>places</OL></laughter>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I usually go out on the weekends. <F>Erm</F> just to different places in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> last weekend, I went to Asakusa all day.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> and then Sunday, I went to the Meiji Temple. <F>Erm</F> but we usually just find little places to go to for day trips. And sometimes we take a long weekend. <F>Erm</F> but it's difficult because with the <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> schedule, we don't have a lot of free time.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>So</SC> but whenever we have time to go away, we do.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I <OL>see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> but <R>it's</R> it's very different than the U. S.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>You know. <F>Uh</F> on my campus, the dorms are very close together, so you can just walk for two minutes and go see your friend. But here, you've to get in the train for twenty minutes sometimes and then you get to see your friends. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. I see. So what did you do in Asakusa?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> we went shopping.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> and it was my second time there. So I was pretty familiar with the area. But <F>erm</F> the last time we went, <F>erm</F> it was just for a tour of the temple, actually. <F>Um</F> sort of behind the scenes and not a lot of people get to do.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So we went into the gardens and into the pagoda and underneath the museums and stuff.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <R>it was</R> it was very exciting actually. And <F>erm</F> I felt privileged to be able to do that.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> but this time, we just walked around the outside and sort of observed all the people. And I got a chance to see the flow of people and <R>how</R> how they shop, you know,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>if they walk the street down in the middle or if they walk on one side and switch. <F>Erm</F> and I went to lunch with my friend. So that was nice. It's a nice day.</B>
<A>Sure. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Sounds fun.</A>

<B><F>um</F> somewhere warm, tropical, maybe. <F>Erm</F> I'm not really sure. <F>Erm</F> are there any places that you might suggest?</B>
<A>How about Singapore or Indonesia?</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> do you know, once I get there, how easy it is to get around the area to both of those places? <SC>I haven't</SC> I don't know much about either.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. <F>Well</F> <F>erm</F> a lot of people in Singapore speak English, so I don't think you'll have any troubles there,</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>get</OL> around. <F>Um</F> Indonesia, you might need <R>a</R> a tour guide.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Erm</F> in Singapore, what's the main mode of transportation?</B>
<A><F>Er</F> car.</A>
<B>A car?</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Erm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> they have the subway, too.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Erm</F> are there any main <.></.> attractions that you think I should see in Singapore? <R>I'm not</R> I'm not <F>um</F> familiar with the area. So <F>um</F> are there any cities that I should see <F>er</F> or places I should visit?</B>
<A><F>Well</F> it's a nice <SC>mixture of</SC> mixture of, you know, the city life and a lot of <F>um</F> botanical gardens. <OL><F>Mm-hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL> <CO>So</CO>.</A>
<B>The areas around the botanical gardens, do they have hotels?</B>
<A><F>Um</F> yes, a few.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Erm</F> do you think you might be able to help me <F>um</F> book a flight and a hotel in one of those</B>
<A>Of course.</A>
<B>areas?</B>
<A>Sure. So I'll put a package together for you.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>Great.</B>
<A>And I'll call you when it's ready.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>All right.</A>
<B>Thank <OL>you</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>That's</OL> the end of <R>the</R> the role-play.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. So <F>um</F> <.></.> where have you traveled recently? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Erm</F> I think it was about almost a month ago actually. <F>Um</F> <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> took a trip to Kyushu.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> and we flew into Fukuoka Airport and drove to Kumamoto. And then continued on to Uemura and we stayed there for six days. <F>Erm</F> each of us stayed with a host family. <F>Er</F> I visited an elementary school while I was there. And we went rafting down the Kuma <JP>Gawa</JP>. <F>Er</F> my host family took me to Mount Aso. And I really, really liked the area. <F>Um</F> quite different from <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. But it was nice to get away for a few days.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> and then two weeks ago, I flew back down to Kyushu to see my aunt in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I haven't seen her in seventeen and a half years,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>so</OL> it was quite a reunion and it was a <R>very</R> very nice visit.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><R>And</R> and she was just very, very warm to me and I felt like no time had passed. And you know, I didn't remember too much about her because I was three</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>the last time I saw her. <SC>But</SC> <F>erm</F> and we went to Sasebo one day and just went around the area. And so that's <nvs>laughter</nvs> the last big trip that I took.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Erm</F></OL> so it was a very good trip.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I see. And how did you keep in touch with her all these years?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> it was very difficult to. <F>Erm</F> because <F>erm</F> she hasn't seen my grandma</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>in seventeen and a half years either.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> and it's very, very hard for them to see each other or talk to each other because they're so far away.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And now, my grandma is too old to fly to Japan. And my aunt isn't able to fly to America. So the distance is really taking a toll on them. <F>Erm</F> but I think every few months, my aunt sends a package to my grandma with magazines and a letter and food. And my grandma writes letters to her. So the relations have basically been through my grandma.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> so it meant a lot to my whole family about me being able to go visit her.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. I'm glad you did. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>

<stage4>
<task>
<A>O K. Yeah. It's the last task here. <F>Hm</F>. I'll show you some pictures and I want you to make up a story.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A><nvs>cough</nvs> Excuse me. <.></.> O K? So the pictures go this way. And this happened before. So if you can start the story with, "One day last week".</A>
<B>One day last week, <F>erm</F> John and Maria were walking down the street when it was raining. And they both had their umbrellas up. And they heard a noise coming from a box on the side of the street. And John recognized it first and told Maria about it. So Maria bent down <F>erm</F> and opened the box. And there was a kitten in there. So she picked up the kitten. And she asked John if she could take it home. And he said, "No. You know, I really don't want you to take it home.". And Maria said, "Please. It would mean a lot to me. " And then John said, "<F>Well</F> I'm not quite sure.". He said, "But I guess it would be O K.". So <F>erm</F> John held his umbrella over Maria and the kitten. And they continued home.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Erm</F> <.></.> when you have a disagreement with someone,</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F></B>
<A>how do you usually resolve it?</A>
<B>I usually <.></.> take sometime for myself first <F>erm</F> to think about everything and what I wanna say, <F>erm</F> I bite my tong.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I don't wanna say something that I'm gonna regret later.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I usually go in my room and listen to some music to clear my head a little bit. And then we usually talk about it later. <F>Erm</F> we usually don't sit down and say, "O K, we're going to <F>erm</F> clear this whole situation up.". But it sort of comes up in conversation and we resolve it then. So in conversation we say, "<R>You know</R> <F>oh</F> you know, I wanna talk to you about that.". Yeah. <F>Erm</F> it just sort of fits into the context of the conversation.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I see. <F>Hm</F>. O K.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>Next, lastly, <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>O K. Again, there are six pictures. If you could make a story.</A>
<B><nvs>cough</nvs></B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures.</ctxt>
<B>O K. One day last week, <F>erm</F> Jerry had come home from college. And his dad decided to take him out to dinner. So his dad asked him which restaurant he wanted to go to. So Jerry pointed to one restaurant and so his dad said, "O K.". So they went in. And he told the waiter <F>erm</F> all about Jerry coming home from college and he was just very excited. <SC>He wanted him to be</SC> <F>uh</F> he wanted it to be a special night. So the two of them sat down. And the waitress came over. And they ordered, looks like, fried chicken and fish. And <SC>they</SC> Jerry had a beer and his dad ordered a glass of wine. And then they decided they got full. So his dad paid the bill. And they left <F>er</F> <SC>ra</SC> the restaurant. And Jerry had another obligation that night. So he said thank you to his dad and left to enjoy the rest of the events for the night.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Um</F> could you tell me about a good restaurant that you go to in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> or in Japan?</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. <.></.> I usually don't go out that much</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>to eat. <F>Erm</F> just because I try to save a little bit of money.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I usually eat lunch at <H pn="school name1">XXX07</H> in one of the cafeterias.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> because that's where all my friends are. <F>Erm</F> so we usually call each other and say, "Where are you eating lunch?"</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And so we'll have lunch together. And sometimes it's just two of us, sometimes it's a big group. So <F>erm</F> <?>at least I</?> enjoy socializing with my friends and seeing them everyday.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>How do you like Japanese food?</A>
<B>I love it.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I love it. My grandma's cooked it a lot</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>um</F> as I've grown up. So I've gotten used to the taste.</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <SC>and I think my favorite thing</SC> <F>hm</F></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>I'm not a huge fan of sushi, but I do like <JP>wakame udon</JP>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So that's one of my favorite things here.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><SC>And there're also</SC> I'm not sure what they are called exactly, but I know they are pickles, the yellow, some kind of vegetable.</B>
<A>U-huh.</A>
<B>I like that with rice.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So if you don't go out that much, you must cook.</A>
<B>I do.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. What's <F>er</F> <SC?>your</SC?></A>
<B><F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A>a good recipe that you often make?</A>
<B>I usually make rice with <JP>shumai</JP></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>and</OL> miso soup.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I'm trying to stay away from American food while I'm here.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I don't go to McDonald's, I don't go to Wendy's. <F>Erm</F> I want to. But I can get that at home. So I figured while I can, I get the unique Japanese taste. And a lot of my friends, you know, they say, "I can't believe you have to cook for yourself every night.". And I say, "<F>Well</F> I don't mind."</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I like it a lot. And I like cooking and experimenting. Not too much</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>but enough. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. So you make <JP>shumai</JP> from scratch?</A>
<B>No. <R>I buy that</R></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>I buy that from the store.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>But everything else</OL>, I try to do it myself. Just so that I can learn. And, you know, when I go home, I can cook with my grandma now.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. <OL><?>That's right</?></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And <F>erm</F></OL> so since she hasn't been here for so long, maybe I can teach her some new things and she can teach me some old things. So that would be nice.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I see. O K. So <F>um</F> what else do you want to do in the rest of the time while you are here?</A>
<B>I wanna travel as much as I can. <F>Erm</F> I have a lot of work coming up but that's second on my list. <F>Erm</F> at home, normally it'd be number one. But I'm in Japan. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So I'm planning to go to Kyoto next weekend.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><R>And</R> and then <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> is going to British Hills in Nikko at the end of the month, Thanksgiving. And then, I think, the third week in December, a few friends and I are going to Hiroshima. So that'll be an exciting trip because we have finals the next week.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>So we just wanna get away before finals and then pack and get ready to go back to America.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. So your trip to Kyoto, how are you going to arrange that?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> because we're kind of students, we were able to apply for a twenty-percent discount.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>erm</F> we have the discount tickets.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So we</OL> just have to go <F>erm</F> buy the <JP>shinkansen</JP> tickets. And we have to book a hostel on line. So there's a lot of work involved but it's definitely worth it in the end.</B>
<A>Sure. It must be beautiful now. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> I can't wait to see it.</B>
<A>Right.</A>

<A>O K. So we're wrapping up. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> do you have a busy schedule tonight?</A>
<B>Tonight, I do.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Erm</F> I have some friends coming over tomorrow evening. So I have to clean</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>and go grocery shopping.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <SC>so I</SC> there's a time limit as to when they can stay, so I have to, you know, take them home pretty early. Cook dinner, socialize for a while and then <F>erm</F> walk them back to the train station. Plus, I have a quiz tomorrow. And a mid-term on Monday. So</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>pretty hectic. But I think these next two trips coming up or three trips, actually, will be a nice reward.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So are you going to heat up some <JP>shumai</JP> for them? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter>I'm actually gonna make fried rice</laughter></B>
