<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>Do you like it there?</A>
<B>Yeah. <SC>It's</SC> <F>ur</F> I live with a seventy-four-year-old <F>urm</F> woman.</B>
<A>Really?</A>
<B>Yeah. So it's a host family stay. And, <F>ur</F> yeah, <SC>it's</SC> I have a lot of freedom, and it's pretty nice. <OL><F>Mm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. O K. Something more about the host family?</A>
<B>O K. <F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> it's basically me and <F>ur</F> her. She's a widow. <SC>She</SC> <F>urm</F> it's me, her, and she has a little tiny dog that lives outside. <F>Ur</F> she hasn't named the dog, the Dog's the name. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><nvs>cough</nvs> <SC>She's</SC> <R>she has</R> she has had <R>a lot</R> a lot of the same type of dog. It's a Pomeranian.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F></A>
<B><F>Urm</F> so <SC>she calls all of</SC> she's called all of her dogs wan-wan <R>which is</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <R>which is</R> which is <SC>bowwow</SC> basically naming your dog, "Bowwow". And <F>ur</F> we talk usually in breakfast and at dinnertime <F>urm</F> <F>ur</F> because she's usually sleeping because <SC>she's seventy</SC> actually <R>she's seventy-six</R> she's seventy-six, not seventy-four. <F>Urm</F> <SC>s</SC> <F>ur</F> and her birthday <SC>was like about</SC> it was last month. And so she's seventy-six years old. And so she's always sleeping. And so we don't really talk that much, maybe at like <F>ur</F> dinner and stuff. <F>Ur</F> and <SC>I ha</SC> <SC>she has every</SC> like every other week on Wednesdays, she has a <F>ur</F> English conversation party that I help her out with. And <F>ur</F> basically, I just tell her if I can't come home or if I'm gonna be home late, <SC>and then whenever she doesn't</SC> so she doesn't have to prepare <F>mm</F> dinner. And <SC>everything is</SC> <SC>she's</SC> lots of freedom. And <F>ur</F> I have a T V in my room. <F>Ur</F> and <F>mm</F></B>
<A>O K. <OL>All right</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>maybe that's about it</OL>. Yeah.</B>
<A>So what goes on in this English conversation party?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> at the English conversation party, basically it's just me and <SC>u</SC> about maybe five or six, <F>ur</F> they're <SC>Japanese native speakers</SC> Japanese people <SC>who're like</SC> basically all we do is we just speak in English. I mean, <SC>there is nothing really</SC> <F>uh</F> we just eat and speak in English. And <R>sometimes</R> sometimes it ends up being just like me speaking in Japanese, too because like they don't understand the English. But like they just <F>uu</F> try to get together and speak as much English as possible. <SC>It's usu</SC> <SC>it's actu</SC> <SC>they're like</SC> the ages range, really from like twenty-five to like seventy <laughter>six</laughter>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><SC>So</SC> but</OL> she's like the oldest one.</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>They're like</R></OL> they're like forties, fifties,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>most of them.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>And how's your Japanese?</A>
<B>My Japanese? <F>Ur</F> it's O K. It's a lot better than when I first came here. Like <SC>if</SC> I didn't really think it was getting that much better, but like I realize that <SC>my</SC> I'm processing it a lot faster so that I might be able to speak a lot easier in Japanese. But <F>um</F> <R>it's</R> <SC>it's still like</SC> it's still not fluent or anything, but <SC>like I still can't</SC> like if I watch T V, I can't understand. But maybe like approximately, <OL>I can</OL> understand.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. Great. So other than taking classes, <F>um</F> what do you do to <OL>improve your language</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL> <F>Urm</F> <SC>watch</SC> I watch <SC>televi</SC> Japanese television. <SC>I read</SC> <F>ur</F> I bought a lot of <JP>manga</JP> that I'm trying to read. <F>Urm</F> so I sit down with the <JP>manga</JP>, and like I put my electronic dictionary to my right, and just look up the words I don't know. <F>Urm</F> <SC>problem is like</SC> <R>the</R> the biggest like problem in learning Japanese is learning colloquial</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>ur</F> because they don't teach it at the school, <R>and</R> and like it's used a lot in television and in <JP>mangas</JP>. So like <SC>there's like <R>cer</R> a certain colloq</SC> that like you have a certain amount of colloquial expressions like knowledge of certain expressions, but like <SC>you don't know like certain</SC> <SC>there's like a lot of</SC> sometimes they use a lot of bad words, I guess. So like they don't teach <laughter>in the class</laughter>. <SC>So like <F>ur</F> I don't</SC> but I don't know whether it's bad word or not. So like if I ask a Japanese native speaker like, "What this word means?". They're like, "<F>Ohh</F> yeah, <SC>you can say</SC> you shouldn't say that, you shouldn't say that.". But I still wanna know just so I know it's a bad word.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>So but <SC?>la</SC?> that's like <F>mm</F> the biggest obstacle. That and like there's like certain grammar, and <SC>there</SC> sometimes I don't know if it's grammar or <SC>if it's like</SC> if it's the word or if it's like a dictionary word I don't know.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <JP>manga</JP>, television, <F>urm</F> speaking to Japanese native speakers, and <F>urr</F> Japanese songs, <R>karaoke is a good</R> <SC>karaoke is a good <F>ur</F> way to</SC> <R>karaoke</R> karaoke <R>is</R> is a good way to <F>ur</F> like practice your reading because like it goes at a certain rate so like you try to keep up with it and stuff. And so you kind of have to like process it faster. So that's pretty helpful, too.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. So you've made some friends who are <OL>Japanese</OL>, right?</A>
<B><OL>Japanese</OL>. <F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A>And what do you do <OL><?>with them</?></OL>?</A>
<B><OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL> This weekend, we're actually going to Kyoto. And <F>ur</F> you know, usually we just hang out. Maybe drink or <F>ur</F> <SC>eat</SC> I eat lunch with them or <F>ur</F> the <H pn="others2">XXX05</H> has an e-pal program.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><SC>We</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>like you</SC> <SC>back at</SC> like before you come to Japan, <SC>you have</SC> <F>um</F> you speak through e-mail, and then once you get here, <SC>like they</SC> <SC>they're like</SC> <R>yo</R> your e-pal kind of takes care of you and stuff. So like me and my e-pal are pretty close, and <F>ur</F> her best friend, <F>mm</F> so I usually hang out with them. Usually just have lunch or <F>urm</F> me and some of the <H pn="others2">XXX05</H> people and Japanese people go out maybe to like drink <SC>or</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> on Fridays, <R>or</R> <SC>or</SC> and we're going to Kyoto this weekend so we travel together, too, you know.</B>

<B>O K. <F>Urm</F> looks like a salesman dressed in the <SC>blue</SC> <SC>turquoise blue and</SC> <.></.> turquoise jacket and <F>er</F> blue jeans who is <SC>selling</SC> trying to sell <..></..> everything. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Trying to sell watches maybe <R>to a</R> to a customer in a white jacket and blue jeans. <F>Ur</F> the customer looks like he's asking a question and he's pointing something. But then <F>ur</F> <SC>the sales person is like</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>I don't know</R> I don't know how that could be happening <SC>but</SC> and the sales person is <F>ur</F> saying to come this way. And looks like the customer is just asking him and pointing him <?>about er some</?> <R>q</R> question <?>here as</?> on the product. <F>Urr</F>. <.></.> <CO>Did you want me to describe everything <OL>or <??></??></OL></CO>?</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> no</OL>, <OL>it's O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Great.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Um</F> so have you been to a place called Akihabara?</A>
<B>Yeah. <OL><CO>I</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><?>where there's</?></OL> lots of electrical stuff, <OL>the stores</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. <F>Uh-huh</F>. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Can you</OL> tell me about that?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> O K. <F>Ur</F> it was actually not like the best thing <F>mm</F> that I've done in <laughter>Japan</laughter> because like <SC>it's really dizz</SC> it makes you really dizzy. Because <F>ur</F> <SC>that</SC> then the picture, there's only two people, but like in Akihabara, it's just so many people. And there're just so many stores on the same things that you don't really know what to buy. And in addition, like you don't know whether you're getting the right price or <R>whe</R> whether you're paying too much or paying too little, maybe you could've paid less because there's just so many stores. So you feel like you have to go to all the stores before you can buy something. <R?>That's</R?> that's how I felt. So like it was a little bit stressful actually. I went there to buy my electronic dictionary, and I mean, I ended up getting a <R>good d</R> good deal for it. But <F>urm</F> it still is really just stressful. I <SC>just like</SC> only just said like, "O K, I'm just gonna buy a dictionary," just because I was just tired from the amount of people and just the amount of stores. <SC>Just it's really dizz</SC> <F>eh</F> just your eyes just started <OL>like getting cross-eyed and</OL> stuff.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> <F>uh-huh</F></OL>. Right.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A>So when you get stressed out, how do you usually deal with it?</A>
<B>Usually <SC>like</SC> <F>well</F> as far as like in that situation went, and like it was kind of like <SC>I just wanted to come</SC> I just wanted to go back home.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <SC>I like</SC> <F>eh</F> <SC>there was a certain</SC> there's certain like I have a certain like limit, I guess, like there's a point of breaking, <nvs>laughter</nvs> or like it just kind of like, "O K, that's it.". Like <SC>I just wanna</SC> I'll just get something so I can <R>go</R> go back home. Just because like I don't like the atmosphere, and <SC>just like</SC> it just like getting dizzy and stuff, and like it's physically, I almost felt like I was getting sick because there's just so many people and just so many stores and stuff. So <SC>like</SC> <.></.> at that point, <R>like</R> like in <R>that</R> that kind of situation, like I just wanted to come back home. Like the same thing happened <F>er</F> when I went to Disneyland, Disney Sea. There're just so many people and like waiting in line the whole time. You just get tired and so like <F>urm</F> I just wanted to go back home just like rest and stuff. So I don't know if that's how I deal with stress, but <OL><laughter><R>in this</R></laughter></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>in this situation, it's</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah, sure</OL>. O K. So you won't be going back?</A>
<B>Yeah. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>I mean, if I have to buy something, I'll go to Akihabara. But it's not the best place to go, yeah. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
</followup>

<stage3>
<task>
<A>All right. So now, we're going to do a couple of role-plays. And I'll give you a card, and I'd like you to read it. And let me know when you're ready.</A>
<B>O K.</B>

<B>Yeah. I was wondering if I can get <F>urr</F> the next ticket to New York from here. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Oh</F> O K.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> how much is it gonna be?</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> <F>well</F> it depends on <F>ur</F> the speed of the train.</A>
<B>I want the fastest train.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>How much</R></OL> how much would that be?</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. Express is fifty dollars one way. <F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>

<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>how much are the other ways I could get there?</B>
<A>Right. <F>Urm</F> the next fastest train <F>ur</F> takes half an hour longer, and it's thirty dollars one way.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. I see. Is there any stopovers or anything <SC>on any of the</SC> in the second train?</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> yeah. The second fastest train makes one stop.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. <R>What time is the</R> what time is the first train?</B>
<A>First train is leaving in half an hour.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. <SC>Is that for the</SC> is that for <SC>both types of</SC> <F>uh</F> both the express and the one that makes a stopover?</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> no. The second one will leave five minutes later.</A>
<B>I see. <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>Urm</F> O K. Then I'll take the first train out of here. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. All right. So <F>urm</F> yeah, fifty dollars for one ticket.</A>
<B>Yeah. One way.</B>
<A>O K, one way. Here you go. Thank you very much.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. <laughter>O K</laughter>.</B>
<A>That's the end of the role-play. <F>Mm</F>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><.></.> And so where exactly in <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> do you live?</A>
<B>In <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> O K. So it's a pretty big city.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>A pretty big</OL> city. And I study at the <H pn="school name2">XXX08</H> at <H pn="others5">XXX09</H>. So it's about two and a half hours from <H pn="others4">XXX07</H> <?>if you're</?> driving.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> O K. <F>Urm</F> I don't know about the places. But could you compare <H pn="others5">XXX09</H> and <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>?</A>
<B><CO><H pn="others4">XXX07</H> is</CO>. <F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A>In terms of living there?</A>
<B>O K. <H pn="others4">XXX07</H> <SC>is more like</SC> it's a big city. So like <SC>everything is</SC> to get <SC>to point A</SC> from point A to point B, it's usually like at least to get ten-minute-drive to wherever you wanna go <nvs>cough</nvs> <?>at least from where</?> I live in. <F>Well</F> I live in the suburbs. And so like that's about maybe thirty to forty-five minutes from downtown.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And that's like if there's no traffic. If there's traffic, it's usually about an hour, hour and a half. And <F>urm</F> like <SC>schoo</SC> the university that most of the students go to in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H> <SC>is in downto</SC> it's a commuting school, <H pn="school name3">XXX10</H>. So like everyone has to drive like from suburbs about like an hour, hour and a half everyday to school and back. And <F>ur</F> <.></.> in terms of living, like <SC>there's</SC> it's a lot cheaper in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H> than it is in <H pn="others5">XXX09</H>. <R><H pn="others5">XXX09</H> is more</R> <H pn="others5">XXX09</H> is more compact like, it's a university town because <R>Universi</R> <H pn="school name2">XXX08</H> is like, I don't know, it's the first or second biggest university in the United States. So there's about fifty-five thousand students. So like <SC>there's</SC> <R>it's</R> it's like a university like town so like everything is just really close together. So like, if I wanted to go to like McDonald's or something, it takes me like a minute or something that like drive to anywhere, like maybe two minutes. <SC>But like in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H></SC>, I mean, <F>well</F> there's McDonald's or <?>millions of</?> <??></??>, <SC>and</SC> but <R>like</R> like if I wanted to go to like the mall or something, it's not that far. It's like maybe two or three minutes. But like the mall in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H> would take me about ten, fifteen minutes to get there. So everything is just like really close together like, it's kind of like New York <SC>like everything is just</SC> <F>uh</F> <F>ur</F> because I live in downtown. Whereas in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>, I live in the suburb so everything is just spread out, like houses, residential areas, friends' houses. And like in terms of living, <SC>or like</SC> because I live in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>, like everyone's like living with their parents so like you can't like always <F>ur</F> just like go over to someone's house and just relax and just <F>um</F> talk. But like in <H pn="others5">XXX09</H>, <SC>everyone's</SC> because like they don't have <F>ur</F> their families with them like everyone's kind of like <F>ur</F> more close because like <SC>they</SC> you can go to each other's house and just talk and just relax and just like socialize and stuff. So in terms of like social like freedom, there's a lot more in <H pn="others5">XXX09</H>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> <F>ur</F> <SC>living in the</SC> also I noticed like living in the United States as opposed to Japan is a lot more spontaneous. <SC>Like</SC> so <R>like</R> <SC>like it's</SC> in Japan, <SC>like everyone</SC> like we've all like noticed like that <SC>it's really</SC> you have to like plan like what you wanna do like in months or in weeks in advance. Like this Kyoto trip, like they planned it like maybe <F>uh</F> at least a good month and a half ago. But <SC>like in</SC> <F>well</F> in Austin, it's more like, "You wanna go to Houston today?". "<laughter>Sure, <OL>let's go</laughter></OL>.".</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><SC>Like very, very spon</SC> more spontaneous like, "You wanna go clubbing tonight? O K, let's go clubbing.". <SC>Like</SC> so it's different in that aspect like <R>you</R> <SC>you can just</SC> <SC>you ha</SC> I feel like there's a lot more freedom to do things.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><R>And</R> and in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>, I feel the same way. But like just because I'm a guy, but like if I was a girl like it would be a lot different. Like I know a lot of girls who have a lot less freedom when they live back at home. Like <SC>in</SC> with their families. Like when they're visiting back in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H> or wherever.</B>

<A><F>Well</F> it's a university town so <OL>there's lots of apartments</OL> nearby for <F>um</F> living alone or for sharing.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> O K. <F>Ur</F> I wanna be living by myself. So <SC>how much does the</SC> how much is your cheapest one-bedroom apartment close to the university?</B>
<A>Cheapest one would be three hundred fifty dollars.</A>
<B>O K. How far is that from the university?</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> it's a good ten-minute walk.</A>
<B>Ten-minute walk?</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><R>Is</R> <F>ur</F> <.></.> is there a lot of parking spaces in the apartment because sometimes there is, you know, not that many. <.></.> Like for instance, like if a guest came over, is there <F>ur</F> enough parking spaces for the guest, too?</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> Yeah. Lots of open space nearby so <?>you can</?> park there.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> how big is the apartment?</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> <?>at least</?> like five hundred square feet total.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. I mean <F>ur</F> does it have a bathroom? <laughter><CO>And</CO></laughter>.</B>

<A><F>Urm</F> we have a couple on different floors. So if you want to take a look.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>O K. So <F>urm</F> we can <?>set up</?> the appointment, and <?>we'll go up there</?>.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>All right.</A>

<A><OL><R>That's</R> that's the end</OL> of the role-play.</A>

<A><F>Mm</F>. So have you ever considered living alone?</A>
<B><R>I</R> I have <OL><??></??> over here</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Oh <??></??></OL>. O K.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. <OL>How is</OL> that?</A>
<B><OL><CO>But</CO></OL>. <F>Ur</F> <R>it's</R> it's good. It's <F>urm</F> <F>mm</F> like when I first started looking for an apartment, like <F>ur</F> I ended up having to spend a lot of money <R>on</R> on it because like I ended up looking for the apartment a little bit too late. So like, I ended up having to pay seven hundred twenty-five dollars a month. <SC>So</SC> <SC>and</SC> but it was all-bills-paid and it was furnished. <SC>But</SC> and it was a really big apartment, <SC>but</SC> and it was close to the university. It was a good apartment, but it was just really too expensive.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>urm</F> <SC>like this</SC> when I <SC>get back to the U</SC> get back home this December, <F>urm</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <SC>I have to go sign</SC> <F>uh</F> I already found an apartment. I have to just go and sign the lease. And <SC>it just</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>it</SC> <SC?>it's in effi</SC?> it's <R>an efficiency</R> an efficiency, <F>ur</F> just like a living room space and a bathroom.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So like it's cheaper.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> and <SC>that's like a lot</SC> it's a lot cheaper and still close to school. So like I would rather have that. And <SC>like my past</SC> like in my last apartment, there wasn't enough parking that's why I asked about the parking space. Because <SC>I was like</SC> I like sometimes came home at night, and there was not parking spaces <SC>for me</SC> <SC>for my</SC> for me like <SC>so</SC> because other people had parking space. <R>They don't have des</R> they don't have designated parking spaces so like a lot of people took my parking spaces or whatever. So like I would have to like park my car like across the street <R>or</R> or park it illegally or something. And wake up early in the morning, and go get my car, and bring it back to the apartment <SC>so</SC> before I went to school. Before I rode the bus to school because <R>in the University</R> in the <H pn="school name2">XXX08</H>, like everyone rides the bus to school and stuff.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>So how did you go about finding that apartment?</A>
<B>I just drove around basically by myself. <F>Urm</F> <SC>and I went to</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I</SC> at first, I was looking around <SC>for mys</SC> by myself. And then like I got someone to help me like I went to apartment locator. We went around, too, but like the apartments she showed me weren't all that great. So I just continued on by myself. And I basically just spent <F>uh</F> two days in <H pn="others5">XXX09</H> just like driving around. And at Denny's, looking at, you <laughter>know</laughter>, apartments and numbers, and calling them, and going over there, and meeting with them, and just looking at the apartments. I had to look at it first <SC>before I can</SC> before I decide to rent, yeah.</B>

<B><OL>At Akihabara</OL>? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>No, no, no, no, no</OL>. In general. <OL>Here</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Ur</F></OL> in Japan? <F>Urm</F> finding something. <F>Mm</F> not really. <F>Ur</F> like maybe at first when I came to Japan, like <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> just like not knowing, I guess, where <SC>the</SC> everything was. But like <SC>usually</SC> like actually like <R>I did</R> I do have problems when I go into like bookstore, and I don't know like where like certain likes topics are.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So like usually I'll ask, but <nvs>cough</nvs> other than that, like usually bookstore like just because there're just so many topics and like there's like eight stories, and I don't wanna go all the way up to the</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><laughter>I don't know</laughter></OL>. <SC>Because you know</SC>, and it doesn't <SC>have</SC> say it in English. So like I'd like describe the topic because I don't know the actual word or something maybe for the topic in Japanese. So <F>er</F> maybe <F>er</F> they're like "<JP>kodomotachi</JP>" <nvs>laughter</nvs> like kids or like, you know, something like that. But like <.></.> <F>mm</F> that is like also like maybe at department stores also. Just like places where <SC>there's like eight</SC> like there's a lot of stories, and I don't wanna like look for it, <laughter>you know</laughter>. So I just ask somebody. But other than that, not really.</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> in general, when you find something that you really, really want, but it's kind of expensive,</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>urm</F> how do you make a decision?</A>
<B>In general, like if I really wanted it, like <SC>if I get</SC> like for instance, like a camcorder, like if I went in with the intent to buy, like I would generally buy it just because like I went in with the intention. Like <R>if I'm</R> if I'm going to buy a computer, <SC>and I know I'm gonna go</SC> and I need a computer, then <SC>there's not</SC> like I may go to like different stores. But <R>like</R> like I'll check around first. And then like go back to wherever the best deal was. But like if I'm going with the intention to buy it, then I'll buy it. But like <nvs>cough</nvs> if like I'm looking around and I see a computer and I think like I want it, and <R>I s</R> I still might need it but like I'm just looking around, and I didn't go in with the intention to buy it, then I won't buy it.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Like I'll wait. But like if I go in with the intent to buy it, I'll probably buy it.</B>

<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>

Can I be the guy? <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>One day, as I was <F>ur</F> walking down with my</SC> one day last week, as I was walking down with my girlfriend <F>urm</F> down the street as it was raining. Heard a sound. And I looked down, and my girlfriend was picking up a cat out of the box. <F>Urr</F> <SC>the</SC> my girlfriend <R?>ob</R?> <SC>ob</SC> you know, wanted to take the cat home, but I was like, "No, <R>that's</R> that's no go.". <SC>And</SC> but <R>she kept</R> she kept giving me that face that she always gives me. So I was little a bit troubled, but I was like, "Fine. Fine. Fine. Let's take the cat home.". And she was happy. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. <?>Thanks</?>. <F>Well</F></A>
<B><OL>End of the story</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>when you</OL> say she made the face that she</A>
<B>Always gives?</B>
<A>always does, yeah, what do you mean? <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Like that, you know, the puppy dog face like <SC>she</SC> <SC>in her</SC> in that face in the picture, it looks like she's kind of a little bit like she knows that she can get what she wants if she makes that face.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><laughter>So</laughter></OL> like <SC>it's kind of like</SC> <SC>and that's</SC> and he's like, "<F>Uhh</F>.". He's thinking about whether or not to take the cat home or like you know, he's like <SC>he do</SC> he doesn't wanna do it, but he loves the girl, you know. And <SC>he's</SC> with that look that you know, <SC>she</SC> he knows he can't do anything about it. <SC>So</SC> so like <OL><?>or something</?></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>All right</OL>. O K. <F>Well</F> in this kind of situation,</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A><F>ur</F> <.></.> and, you know, <??></??></A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>on something, what do you do?</A>
<B><CO><R>If</R> if it was me in the same situation, <OL>or</OL></CO>?</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> just when you're not agreeing about something with a friend or girlfriend,</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. <OL><CO>Usually</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>what do you do</OL> to resolve that?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> it depends. Like sometimes as far as like <SC>it's a dif</SC> <SC>it</SC> it's different with family, and it's different with friends, and it's different with the girlfriend <SC>ss</SC> obviously. So like <F>uh</F> with family, usually, unfortunately, sometimes it gets to a point where like you're so comfortable and you know that you love each other no matter what, that sometimes you might like say something that's like you don't mean. And like <SC>or you're</SC> <SC>or</SC> and plus like <SC>you</SC> your parents are like, you know, <SC>they kind of</SC> what they say goes, so you can't really argue with them either. So in that situation, it's kind of like whatever your parents say, and it's kind of like hard to like <SC>solve the problem</SC> like solve something <SC>if you don't dis</SC> if you disagree. <F>Urm</F>.</B>
<A>How about with the girlfriend?</A>
<B>With the girlfriend, <SC>it's</SC> <SC>it dep</SC> <F>well</F> I guess I can only say from my own personal experiences that <F>urm</F> <F>ur</F> depending on like <SC>this</SC> <SC>the</SC> what the topic is that we're disagreeing on, it usually just depends on the situation. Hard to generalize. Like but like depending on the situation and what we're disagreeing on, like if it's something is as far as like small like as, you know, <F>urr</F> "You gave me this look," "No, I didn't," you know, blah, blah, blah, you know. That's not too hard to deal with. But then like if it gets to a like bigger topic <SC>as <??></??> as</SC> <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> such as, <F>urm</F> <.></.> "I have never met your family. Why haven't I met your family?". <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>You know, those kind of disagreements kind of are a lot tougher <SC>to like</SC> <SC>just</SC> you know. Like usually like <R>if</R> if it's like something small as <F>erm</F> like "You gave me this look, whatever, <F>er</F> yeah, blah, blah, blah, like <SC>that is more like</SC> I usually be like, "<F>Oh</F> whatever.". It's no big deal. No problem. You know, but like when it comes to like something bigger and like <SC>that's deeply</SC> more deeply rooted, those kind of <F>urm</F> problems, like even after talking it out, it's still really difficult to come up with a solution because <F>ur</F> it's really just more deeply rooted than like something you can just say.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>It's something you have to kind of do, and it takes a little bit time to get through that certain things. So like those are <R>sort</R> sort of like you kind of like have to say like what the problem is, and then just kind of like give it sometime to be able to solve itself.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>You know, like I mean you have to be aware of the problem, and then just like kind of like to give it time,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>you know. Like <SC>some</SC> like for instance, like "You're not romantic.". <OL><CO>Like for instance</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>No, that's <?>not what I mean</?>,</B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL></A>
<B>you know. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>Na, <F>err</F> like <SC>for instance</SC>, I'm just kidding. For instance, <R>if</R> if I was told I wasn't romantic, <.></.> <SC>the next</SC> and she can't say the next day to me, "You're still not romantic.". <OL>You know, it's kind of hard to solve</OL> it like that.</B>
<A><OL>Right. Right. Right</OL>. Sure.</A>
<B>Yeah. It has to be like, you know, "You're not romantic.". "O K. You're right. I'm sorry. <?>I have to admit I'm not romantic</?>.". So you have to give it like maybe, I don't know, a week or two weeks, maybe even <F>ur</F> longer than that. Because <SC>if give her</SC> her if you give her roses the next day because <SC>you</SC> I just told you <OL>you're not <laughter>romantic</laughter></OL>. That's why.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Right. <OL>Yes</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>But</R></OL> but like you have to give it time <SC>so</SC> like you know, and then like <SC>if</SC> after like a month or so, you still don't see anything, you're still not romantic, then you kind of <SC>got</SC> <F>ur</F> you know, get into it again. But in those situation, you kind of gotta give it time.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><R>That's how I</R> that's how I see it, like it solves itself.</B>

But she said I was kind of like <F>ur</F> going away to Japan <F>ur</F> slash birthday present slash "I'm gonna miss you," stuff like that. So <F>urrr</F> really was nice. And I think that was back in June. <F>Mhm</F>. <CO>I</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>What was the situation like? She just gave it to you or</A>

And <F>urm</F> <SC>as I was</SC> I opened up her trunk, and she gave me like the present. But like I didn't know what it was until <.></.> like I just brought it out.

And I saw her give her look to that girl, and I was like, "<F>Oh</F>.". Like I knew <SC>ju</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>for</SC> right then and there she gave me a Play Station Two.
