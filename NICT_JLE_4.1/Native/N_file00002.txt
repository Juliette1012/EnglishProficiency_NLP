<B>I just took a big exam.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>So I think I did well. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>. <OL>What kind of exam was it</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>So <R>we</R> we had the</OL> <SC><JP>kanji</JP></SC> Japanese <JP>kanji</JP>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> It was a <R>little</R> <F>ur</F> little difficult,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>but I studied very hard.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><CO>And I think I did well so</CO>.</B>
<A>What's the most difficult thing about <F>ur</F> memorizing <JP>kanji</JP>?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> pronunciation.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>All the different kinds of pronunciation that even just one <JP>kanji</JP> <OL>can have</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>And you mentioned you're from <H pn="others1">Chicago</H>.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Could you tell me about your hometown?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> my hometown is actually a suburb of <H pn="others1">Chicago</H> in <H pn="others2">the Northwest</H>. <F>Urm</F> it's called <H pn="others3">Shamburg</H>. So I'm not exactly in the downtown area. <F>Urm</F> but <R>it's very</R> it's very residential. <F>Urm</F> and somewhat commercial. There are a lot of companies that center around <H pn="others3">Shamburg</H>. <F>Urm</F> but <SC>the residential areas are very</SC> <R>they</R> they're kept very clean, and it's rather quiet sometimes. <F>Urm</F> it's enjoyable</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>to live there.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. I see.</A>
<B>I like it a lot. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Do you miss there?</A>
<B>Yes. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> Yes, I do</OL>,</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>quite a bit</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>What do you</OL> miss most about your <OL>hometown</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Urm</F></OL> probably just being with my family.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I'm a big family person. So that's one of the comforts that I kind of take for granted. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Could you tell me more about your family?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I am one of four people in my family. There's my mom and my dad and my younger brother who's sixteen years old. And <F>urm</F> my brother and I have rather similar interests. We're both really interested in music</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>urm</F> which is one of my majors. And <F>urm</F> <R>we</R> we like the <R>same</R> <F>ur</F> same kinds of music, same bands, pretty much.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> my parents are very involved in our family. <F>Urm</F> my brother is actually a little bit rebellious. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <CO>But he's still a teenager so</CO>. <F>Urm</F> yeah, my parents <SC>are</SC> they create a very happy atmosphere for our family. And I love being at home, <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>being around them. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>So what do they think of you living here <OL>in Japan alone</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> at first, my mom was like, "You can't go to Japan. You're gonna leave me all alone with these two guys in the house?". <nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter><SC>So</SC></laughter> but I mean <R>they</R> they are really proud of me, <F>urm</F> thinking that, you know, this is such a great opportunity for me. And they're so happy that I got the chance to do it. <F>Urm</F> and <R>they're</R> they're also happy <SC>that they got to</SC> that they were able to help make it happen.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>It's really nice</OL>.</A>
<B>Yeah. <R>They're</R> they're really proud of <laughter>me</laughter></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>which is really nice, <OL>actually</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>. <F>Mhm</F>. And you mentioned you major in music, <OL>right</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Mm-hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>So <F>ur</F> specifically about what are you studying about music?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> my instrument is voice. So I sing. And mostly, it's been <R>opera</R> <F>urm</F> opera and art songs. <F>Urm</F> each semester I've been in college, I've <F>ur</F> studied in an opera performance class where <R>we</R> <F>ur</F> we study either a particular opera or maybe scenes from an opera or many operas, and perform them. And it's counted for grade. <F>Urm</F> but yeah, like, <R>I take</R> I take lessons, and practice all the time. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And, yeah, <R>it</R> it's been really big part of my life for the past two years.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><nvs>cough</nvs></B>
<A>So what's your future plan? <CO>Are you going to be <OL>a singer</OL> or</CO>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Urm</F></OL> <F>well</F> right now, I don't really know. <F>Urm</F> this past February and March, I added my second major which is international studies <F>urm</F> because I wasn't exactly sure that I wanted to do music as a profession. <F>Urm</F> so <R>I</R> I felt I needed more options to open some more doors. So I added that. <F>Urm</F> as far as future, maybe after I graduate, <F>urr</F> I'm thinking about coming back here and doing the JET Program</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>urm</F> <R>if I get accep</R> if I get accepted, <laughter>of course</laughter>. <F>Urm</F> so that's a possibility. And then going to grad school. <F>Urm</F> but <SC>I'm</SC> I really don't know, yet.</B>
<A>But you have all the possibilities. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Yeah, <R>it's</R></OL> it's kind of undecided now, but <OL>I'm thinking</OL> about it.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. Great.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. So first thing today, please describe this picture for me.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Urm</F> this looks to me like either a dormitory room or a room in a house, a bedroom. <F>Urm</F> there is a girl sitting at a desk in front of her computer. <F>Urm</F> there are two animals. One is a cat sleeping on the bed. And a dog is sleeping on the floor next to the bed. There is a rather large stereo system in the back of the room with two speakers. Above it is a calendar showing a month of June. <F>Urm</F> the stereo sits on top of the bookshelf <F>urm</F> that holds <SC>fairly</SC> a fairly good amount of books and a telephone. <F>Urm</F> <.></.> on the girl's desk, there is also a typewriter next to her computer. <F>Ur</F> and the desk is front of a window.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><OL>So</OL> why do you think she has both computer and the typewriter next to each other?</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> nowadays, <F>ur</F> a lot of students access the internet for information. <F>Urm</F> the computer could be used for internet access as well as word processing or writing papers. <F>Urm</F> the typewriter, <F>ur</F> <.></.> typewriter could also be used for writing papers if she does not own a printer. <F>Ur</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><??></??></B>
<A><??></??></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K. So <F>ur</F> do you live with your host family or are you living alone?</A>
<B>I'm actually living alone in a dormitory.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. Could you tell me more about that dorm?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> yes. It's in <H pn="others4">Barakinakayama</H> on the <H pn="others5">Tozai</H> <JP>sen</JP>. And <F>urm</F> <.></.> I live on the third floor. <SC>My room is fairly</SC> it's fairly large <F>urm</F> for a single room. It came with bed, <F>urm</F> closet, desk, <F>ur</F> dresser drawers and <F>um</F> a sink and mirror, cabinets. <F>Um</F> <.></.> we also have a balcony outside the window where we can <F>um</F> hang our laundry. <F>Ur</F> the windows <F>ur</F> go all the way to the floor. It's <R>like a</R> like a sliding glass door.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> we also have air conditioning units, heat. <F>Um</F> they are very nice, actually. <F>Um</F> when I came, I didn't really know what to expect. So <R>when I</R> when I <F>urm</F> finally settled down in my dorm, you know, <R>it's ve</R> it's very comfortable. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
</followup>
<task>
<A>All right. So here's another picture.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Please</OL> <F>ur</F> describe this picture.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Ur</F> this looks to me like a residential neighborhood. <F>Urm</F> a couple of houses are spaced pretty far apart, actually. <F>Urm</F> it doesn't look crowded at all. <F>Urm</F> there's a car parked on the street, and some ladies are talking. One looks like she's walking a dog. <F>Urm</F> a man across the street sitting on the bench is reading a newspaper. <F>Urm</F> there are a couple of kids out on the front lawn of <.></.> this house are playing. Two are playing catch with a ball. And another is skipping jump rope by herself. <F>Ur</F> it looks to be a very sunny day. <F>Ur</F> <F>ur</F> there's a man jogging down the street. <F>Urm</F> everybody seems to be enjoying themselves and <F>urm</F> participating in their various recreational activities. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. So I got the <??></??>.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>So what kind of recreational activities <F>ur</F> do you enjoy in Japan?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> in Japan? <F>Ur</F> sometimes I like to travel <F>urm</F> even if it's just to be other side of <H pn="others6">Tokyo</H>. <F>Ur</F> I enjoy <F>urm</F> visiting new places, <F>urm</F> seeing new things, <F>urm</F> <SC>learning</SC> you know, getting to know like why they're important to either the country of Japan or that particular area. <F>Urm</F> other than that, <F>ur</F> I like relaxing. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><F>Urm</F> watching movies, spending time with my friends, <F>urm</F> keeping in touch back at home.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>How do you keep in touch with your family?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I actually brought a personal computer with me to Japan, and the dormitory offers internet access for <SC>a special fee</SC> <F>urm</F> an additional fee each month. <F>Urm</F> so I keep in touch through e-mail, instant messenger. Sometimes my parents call me.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see. <laughter>O K</laughter>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>All right. And you mentioned you've been to many places around here.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> where is the most interesting place for you?</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F>. <F>Urm</F> <SC>I probably would have to say</SC> <F>mmm</F> I think it was Takayama, <.></.> maybe.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC>actually</SC>, no, I changed my mind. <F>Urm</F> I visited Midorinomura. I think it was in Nagano,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>maybe. <F>Um</F> I went there with a bunch of people from a different program <R>I was</R> I was on at the time. <F>Um</F> they were all from America. And we met many <F>ur</F> Japanese college students who were around our age. And we got to spend the weekend there with them. <F>Urm</F> we did all kinds of activities, <F>urm</F> played sports together. We had barbecue together. And <F>ur</F> we went to an <JP>onsen</JP> together.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. <R>It</R> <R>it was</R> it was very enjoyable. That was probably my best memory, <OL>I think <laughter>in Japan</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> <F>well</F> sounds <?>awfully</?> fun</OL>.</A>
<B>Yeah. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>

<B><F>Ur</F> yes. I'm looking for an apartment.</B>
<A>O K. All right. So what kind of place do you want to live in?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I would like to find a place that's not too noisy.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I'm looking for neighbors who <F>ur</F> respect, you know, others, <SC>and</SC> <F>uh</F> <OL><R>but</R> but yet</OL> who are friendly.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <SC>I'm looking for</SC> let's see, <nvs>sigh</nvs> <F>urm</F> <R>if</R> if it's possible, I would like an apartment that is fully furnished. <OL><F>Urm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>. O K. We have a nice apartment</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>ur</F> near Ichikawa Station.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>.</B>
<A>How would you like that?</A>
<B>Ichikawa Station. <F>Urm</F> <R>that's</R> that's relatively close. <F>Urm</F> I actually work in Funabashi <JP>shi</JP>. So <F>urm</F> yeah, actually that would work for me.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><OL><?>Thank you</?></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Urr</F></OL> it's going to be ten minutes walk from the station.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Is</OL> it O K?</A>
<B>That is fine.</B>
<A>All right. And I don't know much about the neighbors in that <laughter>apartment</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>What should I do?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> it's not really that important.</B>
<A><laughter>O K</laughter>.</A>
<B><laughter>But</laughter> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>I mean <R>I c</R> I can find out for myself, you know, when I go and visit. <CO>But</CO>.</B>
<A>All right. So I think I can take you there now.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> really?</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A>All right. So would you like to see it <OL>now</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>I would</OL> very much.</B>
<A>All right. O K. I'll take you there.</A>
<B>O K. <OL>Thank you</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Thank you</OL>. This is the end of the role-play.</A>
<B><laughter>O K</laughter>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. So <SC>have you ever ha</SC> <F>uh</F> have you ever found your own apartment?</A>
<B>No.</B>
<A>No?</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>So you lived with your family</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>in the United States?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>Here, how did you find the place? You're living in a dorm?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>And how was it coordinated?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> it was coordinated actually through the <H pn="others7">I E S</H> program. When we applied to study abroad <F>urm</F> through <H pn="others7">I E S</H>, <F>urm</F> there is actually a lady who takes care of housing for all of us. <R>She finds</R> <F>urm</F> she finds host families for those who choose to live with a host family. And there's actually <R>a</R> a couple of dorms <SC>that they've been using</SC> that <H pn="others7">I E S</H> has been using <F>um</F> for the past few years that worked out really well. So I was placed in one of those.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. So why have you decided to live alone rather than living with your host family?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> originally, <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>urm</F> when I started to apply, I wanted to live with a host family. But then I was a little torn between the two. <SC>I didn't</SC> <F>urm</F> I wasn't sure because both seemed, you know, like they had their benefits, but both I think had drawbacks, too. <F>Urm</F> eventually, the more I thought about it, I thought that <SC>I'd probably benefit more</SC> <F>well</F> not benefit more, but I'd probably be better off living in a dorm <F>urm</F> <.></.> especially with my studying. Like, it is kind of important to me <F>um</F> to be able to <F>um</F> have that study time and <F>um</F> to get things done. <F>Ur</F> I think with a host family, like I wouldn't wanna spend <laughter>too much time</laughter> with them. And that wouldn't work. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><F>Um</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter><?>I know</?> that sounds</laughter> so bad. But <F>um</F> then in the dorm, <R>you know</R> <.></.> you know, living by myself, <F>ur</F> <R>I wouldn't</R> I wouldn't be in danger, I think, of offending anybody either. <F>Urm</F> I was kind of scared about that. <F>Uh</F> coming to Japan, I didn't know, you know, what was O K, what was not O K. And I know that's the whole learning experience thing, but I'm still a little worried. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><laughter>O K</OL>, O K</laughter>.</A>

<B>Twenty percent off. That is quite a bit.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> thank you very much. Actually, yeah, I think <R>I will</R> I will take your idea.</B>
<A>O K. And you selected a brown jacket, but <SC>does</SC> <SC>that</SC> the jacket on sale is only black. Is it O K?</A>
<B>Black is very nice.</B>

<B><F>Urm</F> I don't really do much shopping, like clothes shopping in Japan. <F>Urm</F> I would like to,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>but <SC>there</SC> <F>urm</F> many places are very expensive for me being a study abroad student. And <F>urm</F> I'm trying to save my money. So I'm trying not to spend too much.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><SC>But</SC> <F>urm</F> yeah. So also, <R>I'm not</R> I'm not exactly sure like what I would wanna buy, either. So I don't really go shopping <OL>for clothes</OL>.</B>

<B><OL><F>Urm</F></OL> not too often. But usually when I need new clothes, or I feel all my clothes are getting boring, <nvs>laughter</nvs> then you know, <R>I</R> I go shopping for, you know, new shirts or something. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><CO>Do you go to the city of <H pn="others1">Chicago</H> <OL>or</OL></CO>?</A>
<B><OL>No</OL>. I usually stay in the suburbs because it's cheaper. <F>Urm</F> shopping in downtown <H pn="others1">Chicago</H> is very expensive.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Urm</F> but yeah, we have a very wide selection of department stores in <H pn="others3">Shamburg</H>. We actually have a really large mall.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> that's actually pretty well known.</B>
<A>O K.</A>

<B><laughter>O K</laughter>. O K. One day last week, <F>urm</F> a housewife, her name was Mira, she looked at her fridge, and she saw that "We have no food." So she decides to go shopping. She drives <SC>to the grocery store</SC> to the supermarket. Parks her car, gets out, and goes in. She takes out her huge list of food, and proceeds to shop. She goes down each isle, and she takes one thing off the shelf <SC>after another</SC> one after another, and fills her cart. When she finishes, she takes her cart to the cashier, and checks out of the supermarket. After leaving, she pushes <R>her sh</R> her shopping cart back to her cart, opens the trunk, and loads her groceries in the back, feeling very good about herself because she just bought food for her family. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So she goes home, unpacks her groceries, and puts them all away where they belong. Puts on her apron, goes to the stove, and proceeds to make breakfast.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Thank you.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>So how do you usually have dinner?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> in Japan?</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> actually, <R>we</R> we paid for a meal plan <F>ur</F> when coming here. And we eat in the <JP>shokudou</JP></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>downstairs.</B>
<A>How's the food?</A>
<B>It's very good. <F>Urm</F> it's actually kind of nice. <F>Ur</F> it almost feels like we have a home cooked meal, <nvs>laughter</nvs> you know.</B>
<A>Japanese style?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really?</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><R>Some</R> sometimes they cook a little bit more western style food. And you know, for breakfast, they give you a choice like a western dish and a Japanese dish everyday. But dinner is <SC>usually</SC> almost always <F>um</F> Japanese style.</B>
<A>What's your favorite Japanese food or dish?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> that would have to be tempura.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><JP>Tempura ga daisuki</JP>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Did you try tempura in the United States, too?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> yes. Yes, there is actually <F>ur</F> quite a few Japanese restaurants around where I'm from. And I tried it there. And it's actually pretty good in America. But here, it's the best. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> O K. Do you cook for yourself?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> not usually. <F>Um</F> here, no. <F>Urm</F> <R>I don't</R> I don't really have time <F>ur</F> most of the time. At home, sometimes, but I don't cook very much. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>I don't know how to cook very much. I make a few things.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>urm</F> I'd like to learn more. My mom says, you know, she's gonna teach me more.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>She cooks a lot. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>So why are you so busy here?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> my commute to school everyday is about an hour including walking. <F>Urm</F> so I get up in the morning, I leave <SC>at</SC> usually at eight to come to school by nine or nine-twenty. <F>Urm</F> <SC>I'm at school most</SC> <F>um</F> most of the days, I'm at school until maybe four or five <laughter>depending on</laughter> what I'm doing. <F>Urm</F> and then I go home. I don't get home until like six or seven. And then I eat, and then I have to study. So it's like I try to find time, you know, to relax and time for myself. But sometimes it's kind of hard because I have so much work to do all the time. Yeah.</B>
<A>So what subject is the hardest one for you?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I probably have to say history.</B>
<A>Japanese history?</A>
<B>History of Tokyo.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> maybe <laughter>you know much more than me</laughter>.</A>
<B><laughter>I doubt that</laughter>. <F>Well</F> <R>it's</R> it's hard. I mean because our <JP>sensei</JP> gives us so much reading to do. It takes a long time to do. Plus it's kind of skipping around a little bit. Like we study mostly the Edo period, but within the Edo period, we kind of <nvs>rapping</nvs> <nvs>laughter</nvs> you know, skip around a little bit. And it's not exactly as orderly. We could follow a process or series <R>of</R> of events. You know, that's easier to <?>remember</?>. So it's a little hard. Sometimes it gets confusing, and it gets jumbled up in your head. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>Why does he do that?</A>
<B>I don't know.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><R>I</R></OL> I mean, I guess in a way, <R>it's</R> it's kind of organized, but <SC>it's not like</SC> it's not textbook organized. You know, when you have like chronological dates. You know that this happened here, this happened here. And it's like we read about, you know, different things like different aspects of the Edo culture and the people, and how transportation evolved during the Meiji restoration, and going out of the Edo period. And <nvs>laughter</nvs> <R>it</R> it's just kind of confusing <OL>sometimes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
