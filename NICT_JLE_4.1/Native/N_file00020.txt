<A>For the record, can I have your name?</A>
<B><H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>.</B>
<A>Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>?</A>
<B>Yes, you can.</B>
<A>O K. All right. <F>Ur</F> how are you today?</A>
<B>I'm doing fantastic.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>It's a nice day outside. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>Yeah. Aren't you cold?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I have a jacket so it's not so bad. And it's getting warmer because <OL>the sun's</OL> out.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>. Good. O K. All right. So how long have you been in Japan?</A>
<B>Since August, so almost three months.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. O K. How do you like it here?</A>
<B>I love Japan. It's so much different from the Midwest in the United States that I really enjoy it. Because usually I'm around <F>ur</F> small-town people, I guess. And so big city is really different. And I really kind of enjoy that.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>Because it's a change of pace.</B>
<A>Yeah. What do you enjoy most?</A>
<B>The people, definitely. <F>Ur</F> awesome people. All my Japanese friends. I mean <R>it's</R> it's not like it was easier to make friends. But when I got here, <SC>it was like</SC> <SC>that was prob</SC> that is probably a most amazing part. It's just how cool they are, <R>and</R> and how <F>um</F> understanding they are <OL>to me <F>ur</F> learning Japanese</OL>,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>learning the language <SC>and</SC> or helping me. And it also helps that they know more English than I know Japanese. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I</OL> see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>So what about those Japanese friends are cool?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>what about them</OL> is <OL>cool</OL>?</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <SC>they're</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>they just are</SC> <F>uh</F> I don't know, cool is relative so <SC>I just think they're</SC> I think they're really nice. I think they're a lot fun to be around. And fun is different here because it seems so restrained.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But they like to have fun. And especially the drinking aspect. Like because where I come from, <R>it's</R></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>it's more of a taboo. If you drink, it's like, "<F>Oh</F> that person drinks.". So but here, it's just like, "<F>Oh</F> yeah, let's go out and grab a drink or something.".</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>So it's a lot different.</B>
<A>I see. O K. So what kind of places do you usually go for drinking?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> goodness. <F>Urm</F> <R>to a</R> to a bar sometimes. But usually it's at when we go out to dinner,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>we have a couple of drinks at dinner. Or it's on Friday or Saturday night, we go to <F>ur</F> <JP>nomihoudai</JP>,</B>
<A><OL><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>is that what's it called</OL>? And <SC>I</SC> yeah, all-you-can-drink for a few hours and then get a little bit tipsy, <R>and</R></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>and do a lot more talking. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. O K.</A>
<B>But it's a lot of fun because they like to have fun.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. All right. So where are you from? <CO>You said you're</CO>.</A>
<B><H pn="others1">XXX02</H>, <H pn="others2">XXX03</H>. It's around <H pn="others3">XXX04</H>, <H pn="others2">XXX03</H>,</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>United States.</B>
<A>Could you tell me more about your hometown?</A>
<B>I sure can. <F>Ur</F> located right next to a big city or bigger city, <H pn="others3">XXX04</H>, my hometown is <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>, <H pn="others2">XXX03</H>. And <F>ur</F> I was born there. I've lived relatively all my life there. And it's very religious-oriented. <SC>We ha</SC> the church I belong to is affiliated in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>, and <SC?>that</SC?> basically it's starting there, and has a large following there. <F>Ur</F> makes it sound like a <?>cold cabinet</?>. But <SC>it's just</SC> <F>ur</F> let's see. It's a city with two high schools. <F>Mhm</F> <R>for</R> for American standards, I guess <SC>that's kind of</SC> <F>ur</F> it's a little bit bigger than small <OL><?>where</?></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><?>base</?></OL> of that average. So <F>ur</F> small town. There's things to do on Friday nights. There's <.></.> places to hang out. I can go bowling. <SC>It's kin</SC> it's almost country, but it's not country.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>It's too north to be country-country, like Texas or <OL>something like that</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ohh</F></OL>.</A>
<B>So <R>it's</R> it's a nice town. It's quaint.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> except, <F>oh</F> Gees, we're not really proud of this. But a few years back, we were the meth capital of the United States. Methamphetamines, like there's a lot of meth labs in people's basements. And there was a lot of drug busts in my city.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really.</A>
<B>So</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>safe, not always, <OL><R>but</R></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>but a</OL> nice place to live.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>There's a good part of town and bad part of town.</B>
<A>I see. And the name, <H pn="others1">XXX02</H></A>
<B><OL><F>Mm-hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>is a</OL> bit strange to me.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <R>do you</R> do you know what the meaning is?</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><CO><H pn="others1">XXX02</H></CO>. O K. <F>Urm</F> is named after <H pn="others4">XXX05</H>, one of the American presidents.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <SC>it is named a</SC> as a matter of fact, the county that I live in is <H pn="others5">XXX06</H> County named after <H pn="others4">XXX05</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><R>And the ci</R> and the city <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>, was named after <SC>one of his</SC> evidently one of <H pn="others4">XXX05</H> 's greatest quality was his independence or his strife for independence. So that's how we got our name.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see. <laughter>O K</laughter>. All right. And in Japan, where do you live?</A>
<B><H pn="others6">XXX07</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="others6">XXX07</H>. <OL><SC>How long</SC> yeah</OL>,</A>
<B><OL>In <H pn="others7">XXX08</H></OL> Prefecture.</B>
<A><R>how</R> how long does it take to go to <H pn="others7">XXX08</H> from here?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <R>with the walk</R> with the walk and the train, it's only about fifty minutes.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Almost an hour.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <SC>it's pretty sh</SC> it's relatively short compared to everyone else's.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <SC>everyone els</SC> or either <H pn="others8">XXX09</H> students have to travel.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. So do you live there with your host family?</A>
<B>Yes, I do.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>My host family</SC> my dad is a dentist. My mom is a housewife. And they have three kids. And so with me, it's six. But it's good thing that they have a big house because otherwise they wouldn't have anywhere to put me.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><R>Two</R> two girls and a boy are the kids.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>Do you sometimes do something with those kids?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yeah. Sometimes we play outside. It's been getting cold lately so</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>we haven't had a chance to do that.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And the boy, he's not very athletic so <SC>he doesn't</SC> he likes to play video games and stuff. So sometimes we play video games. <F>Urm</F> but one of the girls is really adventurous so she likes to go outside and hit the tennis ball around. So</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>we do that sometimes.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>And throw <SC>Chinese</SC> plastic Chinese stars at each other.</B>

<task>
<A>All right. O K. So first thing today, please look at this picture. And please describe this picture.</A>
<B>Describe this picture. <F>Well</F> the sun is very happy.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And there is a car parked in front of a house. <F>Urm</F> this house looks to be about one story except for maybe an attic.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> there's a large window in the front, and a girl jumping rope in front of that big window. <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>Ur</F> I see a bunch of dogs. There's about three dogs in the picture. I like cats myself. <F>Urm</F> <F>oh</F> there is a cat. There is a cat on top of the car. It's parked right out front of the house. And there seems to be a lot of <F>uh</F> foliage, meaning bushes and trees and stuff. And it seems to be a pretty nice day. Probably a spring day or an early fall day because these people wearing dresses. <F>Er</F> gentleman jogging, and boys wearing shorts playing volleyball in the side yard of the house. Across the street, there is a man reading a paper on a bench. And <?>there</?> seems to be out front of another house. And <F>urm</F> there is a street that crosses the picture diagonally. And down the street, there is part of another house. And <F>urm</F> looks to be maybe about <R>an inter</R> an intersection because this looks like it takes a corner there.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. And you mentioned you like cats</A>
<B><OL>I do like cats</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>better than</OL> dogs.</A>
<B>Better than dogs. <?>Just</?> something I don't like dogs for sometimes dogs can smell. They're kind of gross.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><SC>Cats</SC> I used to have two cats.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Squeak and Flash. And named after their characteristics. One of them would meow really high so we <OL>called him Squeak</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>And Flash because he's very <R>high te</R> high tension. "Pshhh". very fast.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>He chased me around the house. <SC>And</SC></B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>but cats can snuggle, dogs can lick.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>That's about it.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><R>I</R> I just love cats.</B>
<A>I see. So why did you decide to keep those two cats?</A>
<B><F>Well</F></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>urm</F> that's <R>es</R> especially a good question. Because <SC>they were very</SC> they got to be very sick, and we waited a long time before we <F>ur</F> had it checked out and they had cancer <SC>of</SC> like the inside. And so eventually I had to put them down. But <F>ur</F> we kept in this <SC>because we loved them</SC> me and my brother really liked them. But because <SC>we've grown up</SC> like we had them for, I guess, their whole life, almost, <F>ur</F> eight years or so. Growing up through elementary school and middle school and high school. So we grew attached to them and</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>knew them. And they knew us and played with them.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>So it was fun.</B>
<A>How did you play with the cats?</A>
<B>How did I play with <OL>my cats</OL>?</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F>. Flash, I would chase around the house.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And when Flash was laying down, Flash always laid on like side ways. <??></??> His arms would be over here and his <??></??> would be on the other side. So <SC>I alway</SC> if you scratch right by his tail, he would just curl up</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>and then start rolling around back and forth, trying to bite my hand.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>And</SC> so that's how I played with Flash sometimes. And Squeak, Squeak just like to sleep and eat.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><?>I can't</?></OL> exactly eat with Squeak.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>I just slept with Squeak. So when I watch T V or something, he <R>woul</R> would come sit on my chest or something.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <OL><F>Well</F></OL></A>
<B><OL><??></??></OL></B>
<A>sounds nice. <nvs>laughter</nvs> O K.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>All right. Next picture.</A>
<B>Next picture.</B>
<A>O K. Please describe this.</A>
<B>This picture has an open door. It looks like possibly a dorm room or <SC>someone's</SC> just room in general. <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>Urm</F> clock on the wall <SC>says</SC> looks like it says <R>about eight</R> about eight o'clock. And there's a computer in front of a lady. And the lady is next to a dog. And there's <SC>a cat</SC> all right, cats. <F>Ur</F> a bed in the room. <SC>There</SC> when you walk in the door to the right is a stereo system, and the stereo system is on top of a bookshelf. <SC>In the boo</SC> there's two levels to this bookshelf. On the top level is a phone and some books to the left side. And on the bottom, there are books. There's about ten books to the right. And some space and then it looks like a couple of books next to that. Above the stereo that's on the top of this book case, <SC>i</SC> or above that is a calendar on the wall. And it's marked June. Doesn't say a year. <SC>But</SC> then you walk your way around, and there's a clock on <SC>the wall</SC> <F>urm</F> a different wall. And on that same wall, there's a window with curtains. And in front of that window is a desk. And on top of the desk is a computer. <F>Ur</F> the computer has a keyboard. <F>Urm</F> it has <R>a</R> a monitor and it has a regular part of the computer. And right next to that, there is a word-processing machine, <SC>looks</SC> to type papers or something. <SC>And there is only a paper and a mouse other than those things</SC> but some paper and a mouse other than the computer and a word-processor on top of the desk. <F>Ur</F> in front of the desk to the other side of the window <F>ur</F> on opposite side as the window, there is a lady sitting in the chair. This lady's wearing a skirt and a sweater. And she <F>eu</F> has a hand out towards the computer. And she seems to be looking <F>ur</F> the other direction in towards the room. <F>Ur</F> don't really know why. Maybe she's looking at her dog. But her dog's on the ground. She seems to be staring at her cat. But the cat's just sleeping on the bed.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And next to the chair that the lady sitting in, there is a trash can. And besides the light switch and a plug, it seems to be all there is in the room.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Ur</F> do you have your own room in <H pn="others6">XXX07</H>?</A>
<B>Yes, I do.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>As</OL> a matter of fact, I was surprised how big it was. I also have my own lap-top computer in there.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B><SC>And</SC> own little desk and <JP>zabuton</JP>. And a futon next to that.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. So do you sleep in futon?</A>
<B>Yeah. Yeah. <OL><CO>Sleep on</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>How</OL> do you like it?</A>
<B>I love it. I used to have a futon in the United States.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><?>There</?> was my mom's old bed. And when I was little there, I would go in sleep on it with her in the middle of the night. And she just gave it to me eventually. <SC>I was</SC> <F>ur</F> I could sleep on that thing for hours, <?>that will do</?>. So it's no different than that. <OL>It's nice</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>. O K. And you use lap-top computer?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yes. Seems to work out very good for me.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Do a lot of e-mailing. So I don't have to stay at school and do all that e-mailing.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I can just</OL> go home. <R>And</R> and <SC>my parent</SC> <F>ur</F> my dad evidently makes quite a bit of money as dentist. Because he has a lot of toys</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>in his house,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and part of that is the wireless internet. So there's no cords. Just sticks in a little card <SC>inside of the</SC> in the lap-top. And it connects to the internet where the port is upstairs, I think. <SC>But</SC></B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>so I can roam free about the house if I wanted to with that <OL>thing</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL> <nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. But I believe the computer is in Japanese system.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> it's mostly Japanese. Yeah. <R>It's a</R> it's a Windows system. So it's easy to operate. And I've operated one before. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And the keyboard is similar. It's a Japanese system.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> <OL><F>mm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>But</OL> pretty easy.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. No problem?</A>
<B>Yeah. Not too much. My room is a mess, though.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>I mean</OL> it really is a mess.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>It's a good thing I have it all for myself otherwise, it could be <?>baddies</?>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. O K. So what does your mother say?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I do have a lot of privacy really. <SC>I can</SC> and they don't really say anything about it. And sometimes I tell them, "<F>Oh</F> I gotta go clean my room now.". They're like, "<F>Ohh</F> O K.".</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>But I have <?><F>er</F> brought a</?> sweeper in there, <?>you know</?>, <??></??> I probably should do that. <SC>But just things I</SC> things <SC>that I</SC> that are not really dirty, my clothes and stuff,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I stick it on one arm on side. And then some little luggage pieces, I just keep it one side all the time. I have books lying out and stuff I need for classes everyday. Next to the computer, <F>urm</F> kind of a desk thing is <F>ur</F> I have tapes because <SC>I take</SC> I do a tape journal or recording journal. Because it's a lot easier than writing.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And some C Ds and stuff <?>just room</?> shall we say around the room.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see. O K. All right.</A>

<A><laughter>It's O K</laughter>. All right. So when you travel in the United States, how <SC>would you</SC> how do you do that?</A>
<B><nvs>cough</nvs> If I was in the United States, normally I would drive because I like <F>ur</F> road trips. Me and my friends take road trips.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> if I was to do that in the United States, <SC>I probably</SC> I might do it on the line, actually.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Or ask my parents if they knew a travel agent that I can talk to.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And then when I go to the travel agent, ask them, say, "I wanna go to Hawaii,"</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>or "I want to go to Texas for a week,</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F>.</A>
<B>and stay next to the ocean.".</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And they would say, "<F>Oh</F> here are some things you can do. How long do you wanna stay?". They'll probably ask me <R>q</R> <F>eh</F> questions like that. I would say, "I'd like to stay a week," or "I'd like to</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>maybe see the Alamo, travel to San Antonio," or something.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>"<F>Well</F> there's a tour going up there the same week that you're there, and da-da-da-da,"</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I'd say "O K.". <?>Because</?> they have a package deal or do I need to stay two nights extra to get this deal or about cheap <OL>airfare</OL>,</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>cheap accommodations.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. O K. <CO>And <OL>this</OL></CO>.</A>
<B><OL>Cheap</OL>, cheap cheap.</B>
<A><laughter>Cheap, cheap, cheap</laughter>. So you mentioned you like road trip rather than <SC>air tri</SC> air travel, <OL>whatever</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A>Why do you like road travel?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>ur</F> for a college student, it's more economical. <F>Ur</F> during the summer, me and my friends work a lot.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And it's easy to take a weekend road trip. My mom lives in <H pn="others9">XXX10</H>, <H pn="others10">XXX11</H> as a matter of fact.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And I'm from <H pn="others3">XXX04</H>. So during the summer me and my brother, we drive twelve hours down to <H pn="others9">XXX10</H>. And it's very tiring, but it's a lot of fun just because in one summer, we took our friends down there, too, when we had two cars. So it was fun. We had walkie-talkies <OL>between the cars</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>And so it was fun just to talk back and forth and mess around.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>Speed up, slow down, speed up, slow down. Just kind of hang out. Stop where we wanted to stop. And go at our own pace.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Sounds a lot of fun.</A>

<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>

<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> So <R>ww</R> what's the impression, watching an American movie in Japanese?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I was trying to read their lips.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Because they were speaking in English</OL>. But all I heard was Japanese and so about ten minutes and I just said, "Forget it.". So I try to understand as much as I could. And</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>get the visuals from there.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><SC>So</SC> but <SC>it was very</SC> it's very taxing, I guess. Because <F>uh</F> see, I had to pay a lot more attention than I normally would when you can pick up things from an American movie because you know the language.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>But it was fun, though. Because they enjoyed it. And I could tell when there were some funny parts. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>. I see. So what kind of movies do you usually watch?</A>
<B>I pretty much like it all. But mostly, I'd say comedy and action.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>One of my favorite movies is "The Matrix" which is a action <?>pat</?>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But it's a good story line, too. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>Serious mo</SC> serious dramas or something like that, one of my favorite serious movies is "The Shawshank Redemption". And that's a very serious movie based on a book. And I really enjoy that because it's well done.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And comedies. <F>Oh</F> my gosh. American comedies. Jim Carrey <R>is</R> is hilarious. But I will have to say that my favorite American comedy is "Tommy Boy" with Chris Farley and David Spade. I don't know if you've ever seen that. But <F>mhm</F> Chris Farley's dead. He used to be a Saturday Night Live guy. He died of an <SC>overdose</SC> drug overdose. But <nvs>laughter</nvs> he's hilarious. And me and my friends <R>quote</R> quote him all the time.</B>

<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>

And one of them walked in with finger up, and one of them walked in with finger down. And <R>that</R> that they were gonna go see the tigers first. <SC>They don</SC> they didn't know each other. They just met. And they looked at the tiger and the tiger was peeking out at them through the bars. And <R?>the gi</R?> the girl, we call her Felis, and we'll call him Vincent. And Felis was kind of scared of the tiger. Vincent said, "There is no need to worry," and he gave her <?>such feel</?> about how tigers roam in African jungle. Some B S about that. She was really excited, and really taken by that. She kind of got to liking Vincent. They move down from tiger cage to the zebras. But there was no zebras in the zebra cage. So then went on to the monkeys. But before they went to the monkeys, they stop by an ice-cream shop. And Vincent bought, that was <SC>some ice-cream</SC> some vanilla ice-cream, her favorite. <F>Urm</F> Felis had just come from school so <R>she was</R> <F>ur</F> she was weighed down heavily by her backpack. And so she asked Vincent to carry it. But Vincent said, "No, my pockets are full of change so I'm weighed down as well.". So they stared at the monkey for a while. And as Felis ate her ice-cream, the monkey eat his banana right in front of her. And they were so surprised because it was like the monkey had human characteristics. And so after visiting the <F>ur</F> tiger cage and the <F>ur</F> bird cages and a reptile sanctuary, they decided that it was time to go. <SC>And they</SC> <SC>Feli</SC> and Vincent went east and Felis went west. And <SC>they dec</SC> they exchanged phone numbers and decided to <F>ur</F> go out to a bar on Friday night.</B>
