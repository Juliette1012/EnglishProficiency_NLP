<A><H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>.</A>
<B>Nice to meet you. I'm <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>O K. How are you today, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Pretty well. How are you?</B>
<A>I'm O K. Thank you <laughter>very much</laughter>. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, do you live around here?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> which is probably <F>ur</F> about an hour's commute away from here.</B>
<A>Which direction?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> north.</B>
<A>O K. <CO>Is it in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> or <?>is</?></CO>?</A>
<B>It's in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.</B>
<A>It's in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> that's pretty close to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.</B>
<A><F>Uhh</F> O K. That's a bit of a distance.</A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>
<A>How do you get here?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <SC>I take the train and</SC> actually, I start out in the morning, I take the bus to the station, I take three trains, and then walk from the station to the university.</B>
<A>My God. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>
<A>Why do you live in such a place?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> it was my unfortunate home stay assignment. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><R>You didn't have a</R> you didn't have a choice?</A>
<B>Right. No choice.</B>
<A><F>Uhh</F>. O K. What's the place like?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> it's nice. My <R>family is</R> <F>ur</F> family is really nice. <F>Ur</F> I don't have any complaints about them. It's just the distance that's trouble. <F>Ur</F> pretty nice, eat a lot of food, sometimes we talk. It's kind of difficult though, because I'm not very good at Japanese. So <F>ur</F> I mostly just eat with them, and then go to my room, and read or something.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. What's the area <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> <OL>like around</OL> there?</A>
<B><OL><F>Ah</F></OL> there's nothing. It's all just rice fields, pretty much. <F>Urm</F> basically, my house is in a rural division of homes that's surrounded by rice fields, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL>all directions</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>It's <R>real</R> real</OL> Japan.</A>
<B>I guess <laughter>so</laughter>.</B>
<A>Quite <F>er</F> more real than living around here.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Uh</F>. I see. <CO>And you've been in this program for</CO>?</A>
<B>For two months now.</B>
<A>O K. If I may ask, why did you decide to join this program?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <SC>I wasn't</SC> I don't know. <F>Well</F> I really just wanted to get out of the States for a while. And this is the program that my <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> study abroad director suggested to me. So I went ahead with it.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <R>how</R> how do you get on to this program? <F>Mm</F> is there a procedure involved?</A>
<B>There's just tons of paper work.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Urr</F></OL> just <F>ur</F> you apply, do a lot of paper work, <F>ur</F> get your passport, your air ticket, and fill out a bunch of forms. That's pretty much it.</B>
<A>So pretty much anybody can join if they have the tolerance for that paper work.</A>
<B>That and <F>urm</F> yeah, a certain grade requirements, I think. But <F>ur</F> I'm not sure what the <R>exact</R> exact numbers are on this.</B>
<A>Still, you're enjoying it?</A>
<B>More or less.</B>
<A><laughter>O K, <F>er</F> <?>that comes</?> <??></??> more</laughter>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>. O K. What are you doing on the weekends?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> sometimes I go out with friends, a lot of time I hang around the house and play guitar or I read or study. <F>Urm</F> since I live so far, it's difficult to do a lot of traveling <OL>like to Tokyo</OL>. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><OL>Sure, sure</OL>. Sure. You brought your own guitar?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I bought one here.</B>
<A>O K. O K. And what kind of music do you play?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <R>it's</R> it's acoustic guitar, and I play acoustic rock, folk, that sort of thing.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F>. How did you learn to play guitar?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> started, I guess, when I was around thirteen.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ur</F> I just played, and I took lessons for about a year. Since then, I've just been playing on my own and <F>er</F> just mostly writing music by ear.</B>
<A>Never played in a band?</A>
<B>Yeah. <R>I played</R> I played in some bands, and <F>ur</F> performed solo. <F>Urm</F> but <R>I</R> I pretty much prefer to play solo, I think.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Tell me about the last time you played a solo gig.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> actually last time was probably <F>ur</F> three, four weeks ago. And it wasn't really a gig. <SC>I just</SC> <F>ur</F> I was at a party, and there was a performer there and played, and after he got off the stage, I grabbed his guitar and <?>got up</?> I played a number of songs. I'd had enough <JP>shouchu</JP> to convince me to do it. <laughter><CO>So</CO></laughter>.</B>
<A>You got more applause than he did?</A>
<B>I'd say so. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter>Good, good</laughter>. <laughter>That's the important thing</laughter>.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. We have <SC>abo</SC> a few tasks that we have to do today, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, if you don't mind. First of all, I'd like you to take a look at this picture, and I'd like you to describe this picture in detail.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> it's a picture of a restaurant. The waiter is <F>ur</F> offering a bottle of wine to two people here in the foreground. And <F>ur</F> <F>urr</F> there's a number of wine glasses on the table. That's four wine glasses for two people, that's funny. In the background, there is a lady playing guitar and grandfather clock, two more tables and another waiter.</B>
<A>Anything else?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> there is a cart <F>ur</F> beside the waiter in the foreground. <F>Ur</F> it's got number of different bottles and glasses and boxes. And further in the background, there is some trees. <F>Ur</F> <.></.> there's a doorway with <F>er</F> some kind of rope strung across it.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. Now <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, <SC>since</SC> <R>in</R> in Tokyo or in the area where you are, have you discovered any good restaurant?</A>
<B><.></.> I've been to a number of places that I thought the food was good.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. Tell me about one of those places.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> one of them was <F>er</F> very small. <F>Ur</F> only had two tables. <R>Both were in</R></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>er</F> both were in their own little private rooms. And <F>ur</F> <R>it was</R> it was actually a really fine meal. There was <SC>a lot of</SC> <F>ur</F> probably like nine courses, and <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> really, really nice gourmet Japanese food. <F>Ur</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> lots of seafood, obviously. There was <F>ur</F> some fried shrimp involved or in another course is <F>er</F> scallops and fish and</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>there's all kinds of different things. <CO>It's pretty</CO>.</B>
<A>Pretty fancy <R>for</R> for a student on the <R><H pn="others4">XXX06</H></R> <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> program.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> my family took me there and paid for us. <laughter><CO>So</CO></laughter>.</B>
<A>O K. O K. <F>Urm</F> apart from restaurant, have you been out at all at night <F>um</F> with <R>friends</R></A>
<B><F>Urr</F></B>
<A>friends here?</A>
<B>been to a couple of bars. <F>Ur</F> but <F>ur</F> I'm not really big on night life.</B>
<A>O K. What was your impression of the Japanese bar?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>mm</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> I was really surprised that the beer is <SC>more expen</SC> so much more expensive than the liquor. It seems to be reversed than it is in the United States where liquor is usually more expensive, and beers less expensive.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> but <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> <R>it's</R> <SC>it's</SC> I think <R>it's</R> it's similar to American bar, I think. Except <F>ur</F> maybe not so many T Vs and sports paranoid.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> but <F>ur</F> you know, the <R>same</R> same social environment, I think. Same atmosphere.</B>
<A>O K. O K.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>Now, we have one more picture to describe. If you could have a look at this one, and try to describe that <OL>in detail</OL> for me.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <F>Ur</F> this looks a whole a lot like <F>ur</F> Japanese classes that I've <laughter>been here</laughter> because the students are completely not concerned with the <laughter>class</laughter>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Ur</F> there is a person blowing a bubble with gum and people talking, another guy listening to music and drinking <F>ur</F> something from the bottle. There is a girl playing with a telephone. And one person in the class in the front is paying attention. <F>Ur</F> the teacher is sitting in front of the board, and looks like she is frustrated, trying to <F>ur</F> teach the class. <.></.></B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Anything you think she could be doing to captivate their interest a little more?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <F>well</F> in this picture, she's not facing any of the students. <F>Urm</F> and <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> perhaps if she was speaking to the students or did something to demand their attention.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F>. O K. Thinking back to your own high school days, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, how is this classroom atmosphere different from the high school that you went to?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> in my high school, the classrooms didn't have windows. <F>Urm</F> so the windows there are different. <F>Urm</F> also people weren't allowed to use <SC>telephones</SC> cell phones or <F>ur</F> headphones for music. <F>Urm</F> and <F>ur</F> I think the students are more attentive during class.</B>
<A>Yeah. Yeah. O K. Thank you very much. If I may ask, <R>where</R> where is home for you, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> originally, <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>, <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> which is <F>ur</F> about thirty minutes from <H pn="others7">XXX09</H> and thirty minutes from the coast. So it's right in a corner of south-east <H pn="others6">XXX08</H>.</B>
<A>I see. I see. Until high school?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>O K. And then where is your college?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> it's in <H pn="others8">XXX10</H>, <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> which is <F>ur</F> north of <H pn="others9">XXX11</H> about twenty minutes from <H pn="others10">XXX12</H>. And <F>ur</F> it's a <R>really</R> really small town, it's a really small college. It's about twelve hundred students.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ur</F> it's a liberal arts college so everyones there is little bit fruity.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><CO>And</CO></OL>. <F>Er</F>.</B>
<A>Can you <laughter>explain to me</laughter> what you mean by "fruity"?</A>
<B>Fruity. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Urm</F> a little bit out of the ordinary, corky, <F>urm</F> <?>maybe</?> fall into beat of their own drum.</B>
<A>Can you give me some examples?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> one example?</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F>. I would say that people probably <F>ur</F> dress <F>ur</F> less conventionally. A lot of hippies there, I guess. <F>Ur</F> and <F>ur</F> <F>mm</F> art hippies and musicians and actors. <F>Ur</F> and also <SC>a lot of the cour</SC> a lot of the majors that are acquired from college aren't typical majors. They're designed majors by the students. So that instead of graduating with a psychology degree, they invent a art psychology degree or something on those lines.</B>
<A><R>Is that a</R> is that a policy of the college, or is there something else that attracts such corky students to the college?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <SC>I really</SC> I have not figured that out yet. <nvs>laughter</nvs> I don't know what it is that attracts weird people. <F>Ur</F>. <.></.></B>
<A>Is there <R>a</R> <F>eh</F> a college policy to allow the students to create their own courses?</A>
<B>Yeah. Yeah.</B>
<A>So it must be well-known that <R>tha</R> that is a</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A>college policy,</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A>and that would attract people.</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A>So <R>long</R> <F>well</F> <SC>long way from your</SC> it's in the same state, but <OL>it's a</OL></A>
<B><OL><R>It's</R></OL></B>
<A>long way from <OL>home</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>it's</OL> about four hundred miles.</B>
<A>Right. Very different environment, I would imagine.</A>
<B><CO><F>Ur</F> yeah, as far as like the train <OL>is</OL></CO>.</B>
<A>Yeah. Could <OL>you</OL> compare the sort of</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <H pn="others5">XXX07</H></B>
<A><??></??>?</A>
<B>is set in forest. There is huge trees everywhere. It's very humid because we're so close to the coast. Rains a lot. <F>Ur</F> and the land is completely flat. <F>Ur</F> and we're basically right at the sea level. <F>Ur</F> <H pn="others8">XXX10</H> is much more hilly. There're very few trees. And the trees that are there are very short. <F>Urm</F> winter is a very depressing time of the year there because everything is brown,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>and</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>the few trees that are there have lost all of their leaves. You can see brown and gray <?>floor</?> of <laughter><??></??></laughter>. So it's pretty desolate during the winter.</B>
<A>Is there <F>ur</F> <R>att</R> attraction in that desolation perhaps?</A>
<B>No, <F>uh</F> I really don't like the winter there.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F>. O K. O K.</A>
</followup>
</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A>O K. I'd like to try some role-plays with you.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> yeah, I'd like you to imagine this <F>urm</F> scenario here. It's <F>ur</F> a party. If you could read this role-play card to yourself, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, and when you're ready, I'll begin.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>Hello?</B>
<A><F>Uh</F> <SC>ye</SC> <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> O K? O K. We're doing it on the telephone. Hello, yes, this is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H> here.</A>
<B>Hi, this is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><F>Ohh</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
<B>I wanted to <F>ur</F> apologize about not making it to your party.</B>
<A>Yeah. I couldn't believe it.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <SC>it</SC> it's really a terrible thing that happened. <R>I <F>ur</F> was</R> I was actually on my way to your party when the tire of my van <OL>blew out</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><R>And</R> <F>ur</F> and <SC>I tried</SC> but <R>I</R> I went and pulled out my spare, but my spare didn't have enough air in it. And so I had to walk all the way down to the gas station to try to get an attendant, but the attendant was out. And so I ended up having to just call the tow truck and get them to tow my van in somewhere where I could <SC>get it</SC> get the air filled in my spare and just get a new tire for the one that blew out. So I ended up spending two or three hours <SC>t</SC> in this whole fiesta. So I'm really, really sorry.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <R>that's</R> that's something, you know, I mean <F>ur</F> we were all waiting for you.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> <SC>I am</SC> I'm really apologizing. <R>I know</R> I know that it was a disappointment for you so <F>ur</F> I hope you won't hold it against me in the future.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> I certainly won't, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. But you know, I mean you could've called.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I probably could have, but I didn't have my cell phone with me, <R>and</R> and I was just in such a frustrated and panic state that <F>ur</F> it just really escaped my mind to call. I'm sorry.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Well</F> I guess there's nothing <?>that</?> could be done. We'll have another party sometime.</A>
<B>Thanks.</B>
<A><laughter>O K, thank you very much</laughter>. O K. That's the end of that role-play.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Urm</F> you said you don't <F>ur</F> go out much at night, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. <F>Ur</F> <SC>i</SC> any particular reason for that?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I bodybuild. And <F>ur</F> so usually <F>ur</F> when I get home in the evening, <F>ur</F> I eat a lot of protein and <F>ur</F> maybe read a little and then go to sleep. <F>Ur</F> try to get eight or nine hours of sleep every night. So that I'll be <F>ur</F> rested and recovered for the next day.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. <F>Er</F> how did you get into bodybuilding?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F>.</B>
<A>Healthy living?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> actually, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>ur</F> I got into working out to overcome a drug addiction. And <F>ur</F> also, <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <SC>I became serious about bodybuilding <F>erm</F> probab</SC> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <F>well</F> I became more serious about it after I dropped the drugs to <F>ur</F> just attracted <?>to it basically</?>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Sure. It's a good as reason as <OL>any, yeah</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>I could imagine. So <F>er</F> you <?>have a</?> pretty healthy <F>urm</F> food. <SC>How do you</SC> being here in Japan, how do you manage that? I mean the program you had at home is gonna be <OL>difficult here</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>. <R>It's</R> it's difficult in Japan because the diet here is pseudo-protein, and is <F>ur</F> really high carbohydrates. And also carbohydrates that they have in their diet are of little quality, such as white rice and that sort of mixed with, you know, brown rice and that sort of thing. So <F>ur</F> everyday, I drink a couple of protein shakes. <F>Ur</F> usually start off in the morning with a half of dozen eggs or so. And <F>ur</F> I eat some salads and fruits and things. <F>Urm</F> then I go to class. <F>um</F> usually about three hours after breakfast, I drink <F>ur</F> <SC>protein shake</SC> maybe half of protein shake. Then for lunch, I'll eat some <F>ur</F> steak or chicken and eggs that are made at home, brought with me. <F>Ur</F> then I'll go work out in the afternoon. Afterwards, I'll drink another protein shake. And I go home, and <F>ur</F> cook some fish, <F>urm</F> some vegetables and <F>ur</F> maybe some other kind of meat. And <F>ur</F> I drink a lot of dairy and orange juice <?>though the day</?>.</B>
<A>That's interesting. <F>Urm</F> a lot of people would say or <R>I</R> I hear that people say that Japanese food is very healthy. You would bit differ?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> it is healthy. <F>Urr</F> but as a bodybuilder, you have to take in a lot more protein than normal person. <F>Ur</F> I try to consume a gram of protein for every pound of my weight. And <F>ur</F> <R>that's</R> that's absurd <SC>for most</SC> among the people who aren't doing weight lifting. And <F>ur</F> it's unheard of in the Japanese diet to <laughter>have that</laughter> much protein. <SC>The</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>it's</R> it's definitely healthy food, but the <F>ur</F> portions here are very small. And <F>ur</F> like I said, <SC>the carbohydrates are</SC> <F>ur</F> low-quality carbohydrates <??></??>.</B>
<A>Very interesting.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>O K. <R>I'd like to</R> I'd like to do another one with you if I may. <F>Urm</F> yeah. O K. That's shopping <R>scen</R> scenario. Again, if you could read that to yourself, and then when you're ready, let me know.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<A>It can be anything.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A><nvs>tap</nvs> O K. Yes, good afternoon, sir. Can I help you?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Ur</F> I'd like to return or try to exchange this sweater that I got. <F>Ur</F> I realize that you don't typically allow exchange. But <F>ur</F> a very special circumstance.</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> I'd like to hear it.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> my younger brother who I bought this sweater for had died last night.</B>
<A><F>Uhh</F> that is <F>ur</F> too bad.</A>
<B>Yeah. It really is. And you know, I was really looking forward <R>to <OL><laughter>giving</R></laughter></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>to giving this sweater because it was his favorite color, blue. <laughter><OL>And</OL> he died</laughter>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ur</F></OL> yeah. <F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> <F>ur</F> that is a very terrible thing, sir. I'm sorry to hear it. <F>Urm</F>. <CO>But you know <OL>we're</CO></OL>.</A>

<A><CO><F>Ur</F> you <OL>know</OL></CO>.</A>

<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Huh</F> <SC>I wou</SC> you know, I'd love to help you, sir, but <F>ur</F> what can I do? I mean a policy is a policy. I'm sure it would <R>fit</R> fit you in.</A>

<B>He died very small and pitifully.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <SC>I</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>it's so</SC> it's a tough one form me, sir. I mean we don't <SC>hear</SC> have this very often.</A>

<A>We have to just <F>ur</F> ask our manager about this, I'm afraid. And he's not around. <CO>So</CO>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> what would be a good time to come see your manager? <F>Ur</F>.</B>
<A>Maybe <F>ur</F> a couple of days from now. You know, he is an area manager. He's never had a case like this before. </A>

<A><SC>A store</SC> the store manager <SC>i</SC> would be back in twenty minutes. I'm not sure if he can decide this, though.</A>
<B>All right. <F>Well</F> I'll come back and discuss it with him then.</B>
<A>O K. You can understand it's a very terrible situation, but it's a very unusual one for us.</A>

<A>How have you found service so far in Japan at shops?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <SC>service is</SC> <F>ur</F> I mean everyone <R>is</R> is willing and ready to lend their service. It's kind of irritating <F>ur</F> walking into, or not even having to walk into store, but just walking past the store, and hearing six people from inside shouting, "<JP>Irasshaimaseeee</JP>" like non stop. <SC>It's</SC> you know <SC>it's</SC> <R>it strikes me as</R> it's strikes me as so interesting that the way that Japanese people communicate in a polite way happens to also be the most annoying way they could possibly try to communicate with you. <F>Ur</F> <laughter>so</laughter> <F>urm</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I t</SC> <SC>I</SC> actually <R>I</R> I try to avoid shopping and that sort of thing. <SC>Just</SC> or try to do it all at once so that I don't have to deal with all of the <JP>irasshaimasens</JP>.</B>
<A>Right, <OL>right</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Urm</F></OL> but <F>ur</F> on the whole, I mean if I need something or if I'm looking for something, <F>urr</F> they're more than willing to, <F>ur</F> you know, help and try to <F>er</F> understand my broken Japanese to get me what I want.</B>
<A>You mentioned earlier <SC>your</SC> <F>ur</F> <F>urm</F> <SC>the</SC> <F>ur</F> your host family being very kind.</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A><SC>How have you</SC> <F>well</F> <F>oh</F> <SC>hav</SC> not have you, but how have you try <R>to</R> to repay that <OL>in a sense</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>. <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> <R>I</R> <F>ur</F> <SC>I help everyday</SC> I help my host mother everyday with cooking.</B>
<A><F>Uh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> which I assume that she takes that as some sort of reciprocation, but I think it's probably <F>er</F> more self-centered because I really like to learn how to cook Japanese food anyway.</B>
<A><F>Uhh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> but <F>ur</F> also, sometimes they wanna do something that I don't really wanna do. And <F>ur</F> I go along and do it anyway just because it's something that they would like to do with you. <OL><CO>And</CO></OL>.</B>
<A>Can you <OL>give me an example of</OL> something like that?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> like sometimes they all want to go <SC>on a tri</SC> on a bus tour or would like to travel to some place to see something. And sometimes it's very interesting, sometimes something that I'd like to. Other times, it's something that I'm not particularly interested in. <F>Well</F> I go ahead and go with them anyway. <F>Urm</F> also <F>urm</F> my host family's asked me to do a favor to her which is to dress up a Santa Clause in December,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>and hand out presents to children <F>ur</F> for</OL> one of her friends. And as much as I despise Christmas <OL>and Santa</OL> Clause,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>

<A><F>Oh</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, what's up?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I've got a kind of problem here. <F>Ur</F> my nephew threw a Frisbee, and it went right through the window.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> dear</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And <F>ur</F></OL> so <R>it's</R> it's wide open right now. I'm <F>ur</F> trying to cut some cardboard out because it's really freaking cold and <F>ur</F> the wind's blowing in, and I can't keep the apartment warm. <F>Ur</F> I'm really sorry about it, <F>ur</F> but we need to get this window repaired pretty quick.</B>
<A><SC>I</SC> yeah. I can see that. <SC>How</SC> I can make it maybe Wednesday, Thursday.</A>
<B><F>Ohh</F> it's not soon enough. It's Sunday today. I can't keep the apartment warm hardly. <F>Ur</F> what about <F>ur</F> Monday or Tuesday?</B>
<A><F>Urr</F> possibly Monday. I mean you could just <F>urm</F> put some cardboard. <F>Well</F> <R>I could</R> I could maybe drop some <SC>trash</SC> plastic trash bin covers, and you could stick those out of the window?</A>
<B>Yeah. I don't like that, though because I'm afraid somebody might break in.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> come on. It's Japan. No, it doesn't happen.</A>
<B>Yeah. That's what they say until it really happens to you. I would really like to get this window repaired pretty quick.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Urm</F> I can give you a directory. I can't do it myself. <CO>I can drop off the Yellow Pages and you can maybe look somebody up and</CO>.</A>
<B>You're telling me that I'm paying fifteen hundred dollars, what's that in yen, I don't even know, like to <F>er</F> a month for this apartment, and you won't repair this window for me? Come on.</B>

<A>O K. Now, of course, you won't have this problem <SC>at</SC> <F>um</F> <R>in</R> in Japan. But back <F>ur</F> at the campus, <R>your</R> <SC>your</SC> what sort of the accommodation do you have?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> at the university, <OL>you mean</OL>?</B>
<A><OL>At the university</OL>. Not here, sorry. <OL><??></??></OL></A>
<B><OL><F>Oh</F> at home</OL>?</B>
<A><R>Back</R> back home.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I spent the last two years living in a dormitory <F>ur</F> which was both a good and bad experience. <F>Urm</F> it was good because it's right on campus, and literally from my dorm room, anything on campus is about a three-minute-walk away. <F>Ur</F> so as far as <F>ur</F> saving time and being efficient, it's really good in that regard. But the rooms are small. My roommates weren't always agreeable. <F>Urm</F>. <CO>The</CO>.</B>
<A>In what sense?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> you know, <SC>I</SC> like I said before, <F>ur</F> my lifestyle, I come home, I eat or read and I go to sleep. And I don't really have a problem with, you know, somebody going out and living wild a life at night, and I encourage that if that's something that they wanna pursue. But <F>ur</F> it would bother me when they come <F>ur</F> in and be very noisy, <F>ur</F> you know, in the middle of the night, and they wake me up and that sort of thing. <F>Ur</F> and I tried to explain to them, you know, <R>it's</R> <SC>it's only</SC> doesn't take much effort to be courteous and just, you know, not slam the door on your way in or, you know, not talk loudly, that sort of thing. <F>Ur</F> so that was <F>ur</F> troubling at times. <F>Ur</F> also, living on campus, you had to <F>ur</F> subscribe to a meal plan with the school cafeteria. And <F>ur</F> it didn't always <F>ur</F> meet my standards for <SC>cuisine</SC></B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F>.</A>
<B>acceptable cuisine. <F>Ur</F> but <F>ur</F> definitely some <?>upshots are</?> there's a nice gym and I can go and work out at. And <F>ur</F> like I said, everything is really close. <F>Urm</F> most of the students live on campus so <SC>there's <F>urm</F> a lot of</SC> <F>ur</F> <F>uh</F> everyone is really connected, you know where everyone lives. You can just go knock on their door if you need them because you know right about where they live or you can, you know, find out their phone number and dial it up on campus or something.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>So it's pretty easy.</B>

<task>
<A>O K. Two more things we have to do. <F>Urm</F> so I'd like you to <F>ur</F> yeah, look at the sequence of pictures here. It goes from number one to number six like this. I'd like you to make up a story based on these pictures. And the story happened before so I'd like you to begin, "One day last week". And then go.</A>
<B>O K. Thanks. One day last week, Cindy and Sally decided to go camping. They packed their car full of all these things. They had backpacks and tents and pots and even firewood. They got to the campsite, and set up the tent, and built the fire, and started to cook their food when all the sudden, it started to rain. It was a terrible, horrible rain, and the wind swept in most brutally. The tent was swept up <SC>in this</SC> <SC>in a whirlwind of</SC> in a <laughter>whirlwind</laughter>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And Cindy and Sally frantically began to pack everything that they had unpacked back into their car. They then drove to a hotel <F>eh</F> through the rain, through the lightening, and got a room where they sipped coffee and stared out the window at the star. The end.</B>
<A><laughter>You've got a</laughter> <?>uni-Brighton</?> tone there.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K. <OL>Thank you very much</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>A what</OL> tone?</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> yeah. <CO>That's a very British thing <OL>so</OL></CO>.</A>

<followup>
<A><F>Um</F> now, out in <H pn="others6">XXX08</H>, I presume <F>er</F> <?>that</?> is the big outdoors. <R>You</R> you've been camping, hiking quite a bit?</A>
<B>Yes, yes.</B>
<A>Can you tell me about one of the last trips you took?</A>
<B>Actually, <F>ur</F> I had an experience very much <OL>like that one</OL> right there.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <R>I</R> I was with my girlfriend, and we had set up a camp. And <F>ur</F> we'd spent one night there. The next day, we got up and <F>ur</F> left and <F>ur</F> drove into town leaving our tent and everything set up because we planned to go back. <F>Urm</F> on the way back, it start to storm really, really badly. <F>Urm</F> and <F>ur</F> I was actually driving on my way to the park, and the road was cut off. And I was pulled over by an officer. He said I couldn't go any farther because everything was washed out and it was just too dangerous with the storm.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I explained to him that I had my tent and all my stuff set up there, and he thankfully let us go. And we got there, and the tent was knocked over, and it was full of water, and everything was soaking wet and ruined. So we threw it all in the back of my truck, and drove to a hotel, and <F>ur</F> stayed there for the night. And dealt with the mess the next day.</B>
<A>Very, very similar. Worse than this, <OL>I <F>ur</F> think</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><laughter>Yeah</laughter></OL>.</B>

<task>
<A>O K. And finally, one more sequence of pictures for you. O K. Again, from one to six, the same sort of pattern to make up a story that happened before. And start again with "One day last week", and make up the <F>ur</F> story there.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures.</ctxt>
<B>One day last week, Sam was driving his car down the road. Simultaneously, Jim was driving on his moped <F>ur</F> thoughtlessly talking to his girlfriend on his cell phone. <F>Ur</F> he wasn't paying attention obviously when <SC>Sam knew</SC> Sam came and crashed into his moped <??></??> on the side. His cell phone fell and broke, and his taillight was broken also. The police officer was called. And Sam explained to the police officer the reason that the wreck occurred was because Jim was talking on the cell phone. This obviously made Jim very upset. <F>Ur</F> very soon, after a ticket was written and given to Jim, <F>ur</F> a man in truck came by, and hauled off the broken moped. The end.</B>
<A><laughter>The end</laughter>. O K. Thank you very much.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Now, I would imagine that either <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> or the place in the north of <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> or one of those places where there's no public transportation. Up in here in <??></??>. <F>Ur</F> how do you feel about all <R>these</R> these trains suddenly?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, <F>ur</F> it's definitely a necessity for the people that live here. <F>Ur</F> the roads here are really narrow, and not very many people have cars. And gas is very expensive. So it makes sense that a lot of people ride the train. <F>Ur</F> but it's very frustrating for me because I'm used to driving around in my truck, and getting somewhere when I wanna get there, and getting there fast. <F>Ur</F> trains <SC>are</SC> aren't fast here <F>urm</F> simply because you have to wait for them to get there. You have to board them and travel and stop at each place. And once you get to your final <R>ss</R> stop, then you have to walk to wherever you're going. So it's really slow, and it's frustrating. <F>Urm</F> and so <SC>it's probably</SC> transportation is probably a thing that I hate most about Japan. <F>Um</F>.</B>
<A>But bearing in mind the realities of the population, do you think there could be any other <OL>way around</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><R>I'm not saying</R></OL> <SC>I'm not saying that</SC> <F>ur</F> you know, <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <SC>I think it's</SC> I think the trains are definitely necessity here in Japan. <F>Ur</F> <R>I don't</R> I don't think that the population could deal without it. <F>Ur</F> so <SC>it's just</SC> it's something I have to deal with, I guess.</B>
<A>Probably very rarely taken the train before you came here.</A>
<B>Yeah. <SC>I've only</SC> <F>er</F> in the States, I think I've ever been on the train once or <OL>twice</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mm</F></OL>. <F>Mm</F>. I would imagine. Right. <OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And <F>ur</F></OL> I've never been on the public bus before I came here either.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. What's your truck doing now?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> it's sitting <SC>in a shop</SC> <F>er</F> in <R>my</R> my father's shop. <F>Ur</F> he'll drive it around every once in a while to keep it warm.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. <F>Mm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> it's just waiting for me.</B>

<B><OL><F>Urr</F></OL> <SC>I was actually</SC> I gotta go to Sudanuma and talk to my cell phone company and get them to turn my cell phone back on.
