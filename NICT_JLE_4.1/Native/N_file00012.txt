<A>My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. Can I have your name, please?</A>
<B><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Sure.</B>
<A>Sure. O K. How are you today, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Fine. How are you?</B>
<A>I'm O K. Thank you very much. You had a good morning <OL>so far</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Urr</F></OL> kind of. I'm tired. But, you know, so is life. I don't sleep very <SC>o</SC> much in Japan.</B>
<A>Any particular reason?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <SC>I don't</SC> because I have to wake up really early, like seven in the morning. And in America, <SC>I make it</SC> so that my classes start at like eleven, which means I have to wake up at ten-thirty. So <R>I</R> I like to sleep later and go to bed later. <OL><?>Too early</?></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>. So now you're going to bed later, but waking up <OL>early</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Wake</OL> up earlier. Yeah.</B>
<A><laughter>I see, I see</laughter>. Any reason you have to wake up so early, <SC?>or</SC?>?</A>
<B>We have classes <.></.> <F>well</F> today, we have a class at nine, and <F>uh</F> with the commute, <SC>I'm</SC> like, waking up and getting there, I'm an hour and a half away.</B>
<A>You're an hour and a half away <OL>from here</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. <SC>With the</SC> with waking up and getting <OL>to the station <??></??></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ahh</F></OL>.</A>
<B>Though I'm, like, probably live the closest of anyone.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>It just takes you a long time to get going in the morning,</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>I guess. Where do you actually live?</A>
<B><H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. It's one stop from <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, toward Tokyo.</B>
<A>O K. So that's <SC>on this line</SC> <OL>on Keiyo Line</OL>?</A>
<B><SC>On</SC> <R>o</R> on the <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> Line.</B>
<A>On the <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> Line.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>O K. What's the situation there?</A>
<B>It's a dorm. So it's just me and my fish in the dorm room.</B>
<A>Your fish?</A>
<B>Yes. I got fish because my room was kind of bland.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Er</F> why fish?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> because that's the only pet I could have that wouldn't run away if it would get out of the cage.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Because they die if they get out of the tank.</B>
<A>O K. O K. And <R>what</R> what wonderful precautions are you taking to make sure that your fish doesn't die?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> cleaning the water every two weeks and feeding them once a day.</B>
<A><CO><?>That's</?></CO>. <OL><F>Ur</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And I</OL> have a snail to clean the tank. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>You have a snail, <OL>too</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A>So two pets?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>They have names?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> kind of, but I always forget them. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> O K. <F>Urm</F> may I ask, <F>ur</F> what are you actually studying here? What are you doing here?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> I started taking Japanese in high school. <F>Urm</F> but then when I got to college, <F>ur</F> my first semester in Japanese in college did my whole two years of Japanese in high school. But anyway, so I took Japanese and I'm interested in Asia and international affairs, and I decided to come to Japan.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And here, I'm taking <SC>ec</SC> Japanese economics, Japanese politics, and Japanese.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><CO>So it's kind of</CO>.</B>
<A>What made you become interested in Japan <?>or</?> Japanese in the first place?</A>
<B>Because when I was in high school, my options were Spanish, French and German. And I didn't wanna take Spanish, French or German. Because everyone takes Spanish, French or German, so I decided to take Japanese <.></.> I guess to be different, when I was in eleventh grade.</B>
<A>You could've taken Mongolian.</A>
<B>No. It was just Spanish, French, Japanese and German. Yeah,</B>
<A><CO><F>Ohh</F> <OL>Jap</OL></CO>.</A>
<B><OL>were</OL> the options.</B>
<A><CO><F>Uh</F> <F>ur</F> so within that</CO>.</A>
<B>Right, within that, I picked Japanese.</B>
<A>And you are in the minority.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><OL><CO>How was</CO></OL>?</A>
<B><OL>It was</OL> like thirteen kids in my class.</B>
<A>O K. <SC>How was the</SC> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I can't imagine <R>a</R> a Japanese class in the U. S. How was the class?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <SC>it was</SC> <F>ur</F> it's fine. My teacher was Japanese. And <F>well</F> it was really slow in high school. But in college, <R>it's</R> it's pretty fast-paced, and our teachers are Japanese. So it's actually much faster-paced than our Japanese class in Japan. <SC>So</SC> and much harder. <F>Um</F> just a lot of vocab and grammar and <JP>kanji</JP>.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>All that.</B>
<A><R>Wha</R> <SC>what do you actually</SC> or what did you learn <R>in</R> in high school? I mean, you don't know a single word. How do you start off?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <SC>I guess we started off with</SC> like, particles was the first thing, like grasping the concept of "<JP>wa</JP>" and "<JP>ga</JP>" and "<JP>wo</JP>" and why they exist. And then introducing <R>like</R> <F>um</F> <F>uh</F> like easy vocab and learning the basic, like, verb <F>um</F> structures, like "<JP>masu</JP>" and "<JP>mashita</JP>" and "<JP>mase</JP>". And building from there.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see. And has that paid off now? <CO><R>You can</R> you can</CO>?</A>
<B>Yeah, I can chat in Japanese, which is nice, to be able to speak a foreign language. Because usually like if I go to Europe, I have to rely on people speaking English.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>Which they usually do.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>hm</F> <F>hm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>But</SC> and they usually do in Japan, too, but it's fun to speak Japanese.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>hm</F> <F>hm</F>.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> that's good. <SC?>Have</SC?> <F>ur</F> and you've been going out a lot?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Tell me about the last time you went out.</A>
<B><SC>Like to</SC> <F>ah</F> like out at night?</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>well</F> last time I went out at night, I stayed out all night in Shibuya.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>And we went to <F>urm</F> this really bad hip-hop club and this fun techno club. Then I started falling asleep at like four. And so we went to a <JP>ramen</JP> shop, and I slept. And my friends ate. And then we got on the train and I came home when the trains opened again at five.</B>
<A>When you say it was a bad <F>ur</F> hip-hop club and good techno club or</A>
<B><OL>Like</OL></B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL> the club?</A>
<B>the hip-hop was, it was bad music, I thought.</B>
<A><CO>Because you don't like hip-hop or</CO>?</A>
<B>No. Because <SC>it</SC> <F>well</F> I like hip-hop, kind of, but it was just bad hip-hop. Like it was like top-forty music, you know, turned into hip-hop, which is not hip-hop. But anyway <.></.> <OL>it was bad</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>So it was pretty bad</OL>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> and the fun techno, <F>oh</F> <SC>how</SC> <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> could you explain what you mean by fun?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>well</F> I really like techno. <SC>So</SC> <F>um</F> <SC>but it was good</SC> <F>um</F> <SC>I don't know, it's</SC> <SC>I</SC> when I go out to clubs, I like techno because <SC>I</SC> <SC>it's</SC> I think it's funner to listen to when you're out and drinking and dancing and I don't know. But a lot of other people think hip-hop <SC>is</SC> but fun, but I like <R>good</R> good music</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>thereby</OL> allowing me to have fun.</B>
<A>Right. <OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Or</OL> making it fun, yeah.</B>
<A>How do you find these places?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> let's see. We found one of them because my friend <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> went there with her host dad after a fashion show. And we found the second one from wandering in Shibuya. Just walking around and looking and listening to the music from outside.</B>
<A>Just <OL>decided to</OL></A>
<B><OL>And then</OL> decided to go in, yeah.</B>
<A>walk in there.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see. O K. Tell me a little bit about your <F>ur</F> dormitory situation. I mean, I know your room, but <OL>the dormitory</OL> itself.</A>
<B><OL>Right</OL>. <F>Um</F> <F>well</F> like there're sixty people living there. I think about sixty. There's a cafeteria <F>urm</F> which they serve breakfast and dinner. And breakfast is from like six to eight-thirty, and dinner's from six-thirty to ten-thirty or eleven-thirty. I'm not sure, I never eat that late. <SC>But</SC> <F>ur</F> and <SC>s</SC> <SC>there's like community iss</SC> there's two bathrooms on each floor. So about half the people on each floor share bathrooms with toilets and sinks, and then downstairs there's a shower room with like five showers. <SC>Which</SC> actually, for some reason, is never really crowded, even though there's sixty people.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F> <F>hm</F> <F>hm</F> <F>hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <SC>there's always</SC> you can always go to the bathroom and use a shower.</B>
<A>Right. <F>Well</F> it sounds pretty good.</A>
<B>Yeah. It's not bad.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>I have a lot of things to do with you today, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. First of all, I'd like to show you a picture. This picture here. And I'd like you to describe that in detail.</A>
<B>O K. O K. <F>Well</F> this looks like a fancy restaurant. Could be anywhere <F>um</F> because the waiters are wearing tuxedos and everyone at the restaurant is very dressed up in dresses and suits or jackets and ties. And there's also someone playing the piano, with a grandfather clock, <R>and a</R> and a red rope, which makes it look very exclusive. And <F>urm</F> the waiter's walking around, showing the wine, which reminds me of when I used to work at a restaurant and I had to show wine in this fashion. <F>Um</F> <R>and</R> <F>urm</F> <F>oh</F> and also, the food comes out <SC>in</SC> on like the plates with the covers. And there's two wine glasses at every table. And, like, fancy tablecloths draped over the tables.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. <F>Um</F> you mentioned that you used to work <SC>at a waiter</SC> as a waiter. Tell me something about that experience.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <F>well</F> it was actually cool. I worked at <F>um</F> like the only nice restaurant <SC>in my</SC> I live in an the island in <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>. And this lady moved from <H pn="others6">XXX08</H>, kind of fluffy, like artsy cook, you know that <SC>like</SC> <SC>they</SC> like a chef that's like all about creating food as an art.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> but she moved from <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> to open like a coastal seafood restaurant where I live. And I got a job there. And it was called "<H pn="others7">XXX09</H>.". And it was really nice. It wasn't like fancy like <SC>we didn't have to</SC> we just had to wear a black shirt and khaki pants. And you could dress casually when you came. But it had like expensive food <R>and</R> and good wine. And it was all about, you know, presenting the wine and corking it correctly and pouring like while you turn the wine, you know, proper way to pour wine and bringing the food out properly when it's hot. And so I learned how to like wait tables, in the, like, not throw-the-food-on-the-table manner. You know, in like <F>ah</F> proper manner.</B>
<A>Right. Right. What was the training like for that?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> actually, they said I picked it up really fast, but I just trained for two days with this girl, <H pn="others8">XXX10</H>, who I worked with. And <F>urm</F> <SC>I guess they taught me like</SC> <F>oh</F> the main thing to learn at this restaurant was like all the terms for the food that they would use. Like, I still don't know what a aioli is.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Do you know what</OL> an aioli is? <F>Well</F> we had to describe things like, "This has, you know, a lime pimento aioli," or like, <F>um</F> "A chipotle sauce, which is, like, similar to hot peppers.". <SC>Like</SC> so that was the hardest part, picking up all the like fancy food terminology, and then having to translate to people when they were like, "<F>Well</F> what's that?". <OL><??></??></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Right, right</OL>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> that's, you know, plum-persimmon reduction or, like, you know. So <OL>there was a lot of translating</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>That was the hardest part about it.</B>
<A>O K. <R>How</R> <R>how</R> how has, <F>ur</F> restaurants been in Japan? Have you been to a nice restaurant?</A>
<B>No, I have not actually been to a fancy restaurant.</B>
<A>O K. <R>What</R> what was the best restaurant you've been to in Japan so far?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> probably the sushi restaurant I went to last <SC>Fri</SC> it was Friday. It was like huge pieces of sushi. They were really fresh and good. And I really like sushi. It's probably my favorite food in the world. So <SC>that was like</SC> <F>well</F> when my mom comes, she's coming on the <SC?>seven</SC?> eighteenth of December. Then I'm sure I'll eat at a fancy restaurant. But with the money constraints, I'll have to wait till then.</B>
<A>Yeah. Forget the peppermi <F>ur</F></A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><OL>the persimmon-plum</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><?>Plum</?></OL>. <laughter>Yeah, right</laughter>.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>O K. <F>Ur</F> next up, I'd like to show you <R>a</R> a map of a town. And I'd like you to describe, again, in detail, what you see there.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> the town seems to be wedged in between the South River and the North River, <SC>with the train station</SC> assuming this is north, beside the North River, with the train station on the northwest side of the town. <F>Urm</F> it actually kind of looks like Amsterdam. <SC>But</SC> <F>urm</F> the way it's like spread out from the train station. But <F>urm</F> on the main road from the train station, you have the bank and I guess the offices of the town. <F>Urm</F> and in the next block is the restaurant, and the next block is the supermarket, with the bookstore catty-corner from the supermarket. <F>Urm</F> behind the supermarket <F>um</F> across the street from the South River is the movie theaters. Down Route four forty-four from the movie theaters is the post office and the bus station. And then if you take a right at the bus station, you'll see the hospital. If you take a left past the hospital, on your left is the public library. And if you go down the road that the library's on, you'll see the school. And also on the North River is a zoo and Riverside Park.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. So what's your impression of this town?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> it looks very <F>urr</F> much like Anywhere, U S A.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Or Anywhere Anywhere. But <F>ur</F> it's nice that they're on two rivers.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Most towns in the world, though, are settled on rivers. So it's pretty typical. And <F>ur</F> it has a train station, so I know it's not where I live, because we don't have trains.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>It's probably</OL> nowhere in America, because we don't have trains. <F>Urm</F> yeah.</B>
<A>O K. Wonderful. Now, you mentioned where you do live is on the coast, right?</A>
<B>Right. I live on the coast.</B>
<A><R>O</R> on an island?</A>
<B>On an island, yeah.</B>
<A><R>Wha</R> <R>what's</R> what's that like, living on an island?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> it's a big, touristy place, so <SC>all the</SC> all the, like, summer jobs revolve around tourism. Like, I've worked at <R>a</R> a T-shirt shop, where I made T-shirts and sold them to tourists. <F>Um</F> but <SC>it's not like a</SC> it's not an island like most people are probably thinking. <SC>It's a</SC> <SC>it's</SC> there's the mainland of <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> then there's three rivers with marsh in between the rivers, like marshland. And then the island, and then the ocean.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So there's</OL> bridges over the <F>um</F> rivers to get to the island. So it's not like Hawaii or <F>uh</F> <OL>Bermuda or Rhode Island</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>Yeah. And there's islands all like up and down the East Coast of America. They're called the Barrier Islands, I think. Yeah. But <R>it's</R> it's nice. <R>It's</R> it's like semi-tropical, so <SC>it's not like</SC> there's no palm trees naturally. But <R>it's got</R> it's got really mild winters and really hot summers. <F>Um</F> and the water's not blue, because the rivers pour all the silt, like all the dirt - not pollution, but dirt - into the ocean. So the ocean is really brown. But it's still nice and warm. And you don't get dirty if you swim in it, so.</B>
<A><CO>I've heard those Barrier Islands get battered sometimes by storms and</CO>.</A>
<B>Yes, by hurricanes. But <SC><H pn="others5">XXX07</H> is</SC> <SC>the United States</SC> from <H pn="others9">XXX11</H> to <H pn="others10">XXX12</H> goes <?>in and out</?> like it makes like a kind of a big semicircle. And so what usually happens is hurricanes bounce off <H pn="others11">XXX13</H> around <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>, and hit <H pn="others10">XXX12</H>. <SC>Like the last time</SC> we've only been hit by like <SC>two hurr</SC> <SC>three</SC> two hurricanes in our history, one in nineteen-on-two and one in nineteen-fifty-something.</B>
<A>So you <OL>missed those</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><CO>Because</CO></OL>. Right. Because of the way that <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> is kind of in a little cove.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Well</F> <SC>what's it like <F>ur</F> growing</SC> <SC>I</SC> <F>um</F> born in <H pn="others12">XXX14</H>.</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A><SC>Wha</SC> <R>wh</R> what's it like growing up on an island?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <SC>it's actu</SC> <F>well</F> it's an island. It's also in the South. <F>Um</F> <R>there's</R> there's not much there. <SC?>There's very</SC?> there's probably a hundred and fifty kids my age. <SC>So in my class</SC> <F>well</F> I went to a private school, so my class had twelve kids. Twelve to fourteen to eight, some years. And the public school had like a hundred and fifty kids. And <R>that was the</R> that was the town. So <SC>there's</SC> <SC>it's</SC> I wouldn't wanna raise kids there. But my parents like it. It's more of a place that older people would like and the kids don't like. Just because there's nothing to do. You know, the highlight would be going to see a movie. You know, <SC>or</SC> yeah. So <SC>it's not</SC> it's nothing like growing up in a city, which I'd rather do, which is why I go to school in <H pn="others13">XXX15</H> which is kind of more of a city than where I live.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <R>a lot</R> a lot more <laughter>of a city</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Yeah, a lot more of a city</OL>.</B>
<A>Yeah. <laughter>O K</laughter>. Thank you very much.</A>

<task>
<A>I'd like to do a role-play with you, if I may. I'd like you to imagine this scenario, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. If you could just read through that, basically. Get the idea.</A>
<B><CO>Aloud, or</CO>?</B>
<A>No, no, <OL>no, to yourself</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>No, O K</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Um</F> and when you get the idea, I'll start.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B><F>Uh</F> she reminds me of my mom.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> I'm not gonna be your mother. I'm gonna be your travel agent. <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><??></??></OL></B>
<A><F>Urm</F> O K. You ready?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F> <F>hm</F></B>
<A>O K. <F>Ur</F> good morning, sir. Can I help you at all?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> yes. <F>Um</F> I booked a trip with you to Tanzania.</B>
<A><OL>O K, yes</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Um</F> and</OL> I was guaranteed that it would be a very, very nice trip. But <F>um</F> I'm currently in Tanzania, and it is far, far below my expectations. The hotel is not a five-star hotel. It is nowhere near the beach, even though you said it was on the beach. It does not have a pool. And the room was dirty when we got here.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> you have to understand, sir, that <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> five-star in local terms is different from perhaps what you expected in American terms.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Um</F> I would think that, in that case, that you should have probably <F>um</F> notified us that it was Tanzanian five-star rather than American five-star. Because the price seems to be comparable to an American five-star hotel.</B>
<A>That's the state of the <F>eh</F> Tanzanian economy <R>of</R> <OL>of late</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>. <F>Um</F> <SC>is there any hotels near to the one we're staying in right now that maybe up</SC> is there Ritz-Carlton near here or</B>
<A><F>Erm</F>.</A>
<B>anything that we could be guaranteed it'd be nice?</B>
<A>I don't know, sir. And it would take a long, long time to arrange that for you. Anyway, I can't imagine that the room is dirty.</A>

<A><F>Well</F> it's a tropical country, sir. I mean, what can you expect?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> I would've at least expected it to be <F>um</F> a little nicer. But nevertheless, there is <R>a</R> a travel agency right down the street from ours <F>um</F> in our town. And so I guess after I get off the phone with you, I think I'll check with them and see if there's anything nicer in this town that we could stay in.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> of course, you're free to do that, sir. But <SC>I'm</SC> <F>ur</F> I don't think we can do anything with regard to <R>a</R> a or refund or anything like that.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>.</B>

<A>Any troubles on your trips?</A>
<B>Troubles? No.</B>
<A>Never had a problem.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F> besides like maybe a flight being delayed. Like I always think the places we're staying is fine. My mom often makes complaints like that. Like they're not what she thought they would be. But I never have any trouble with it.</B>

<A>What was the best experience in staying in a youth hostel?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>you</SC> actually, when we went to Switzerland, we stayed at this place called the Funny Farm, in Interlaken. <F>Urm</F> I don't know if you know where that is. But <R>it's</R> <F>urm</F></B>
<A>I know.</A>
<B>it's kind of like an all-inclusive like place for <F>um</F> kids to go, like they have, like, on the property, they have a bar and a pool. And like it's in an old like Swiss mansion, but <SC>it's</SC> the rates are really cheap.

<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card for a while.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K? I'm gonna be the nice, friendly shop staff.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. Yes. <F>Urm</F> good morning, sir. <F>Uh</F> how may I help you?</A>
<B>Hi. <F>Um</F> I recently bought this sweater <F>um</F> for my son. But <F>urm</F> I got home, and I realized that he does not like it at all and will never ever wear it. And so I was wondering if there is any way that I could exchange it for something of equal or lesser value, or get a store credit that I can use later.</B>
<A>I see. And, <F>uh</F> may I ask, how old is your son, sir?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> eight.</B>
<A>And in eight years, you don't know <SC>what he likes</SC> and what he dislikes.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> that's not the issue we should be discussing currently. I'm asking you <R>if we could</R><F>ur</F> if we could <F>ur</F> exchange or refund it. But no, <SC>he doesn't</SC> often with little boys, you don't know what they like.</B>
<A><OL><CO>I s</CO></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Same thing happened to me when I was a little kid</OL>.</B>
<A>Yeah. Unfortunately, sir, <R>as you</R> as you can read on the sign, <R>we</R> we have a policy against refunds or exchanges. That's why I asked you about that.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. So there's absolutely nothing we could do.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> I didn't say that, sir. But <F>urm</F> you have to understand it puts me in a difficult position.</A>
<B>Right. If I could go to the shelf and find something of equal value, bring it up here, show it to you, same price, and walk out of the store, I don't see what the problem would be.</B>
<A>The problem may be that your son wouldn't like that either.</A>
<B>That's true. And then I'd have to go home and suck it up, and give it to the Salvation Army.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Urm</F> I see, sir. <F>Well</F> I can't really decide this myself. The manager will have to decide this. <R>He's</R> <R>he's</R> <F>uh</F> he's rather busy now. I don't think he would be back for a while. Can you hang around?</A>
<B>Sure. Maybe. I can go next door. There's a Barnes and Noble.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>I could</OL> read and get a cup of coffee.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> if you could wait for an hour, then, sir, and come back,</A>
<B>I'll do that.</B>
<A><F>urm</F> I'll do my best for you, then.</A>

<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>. <SC>How is</SC> <F>ur</F> how do you find shopping in Japan? How is the service?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> they scream "Welcome" a lot <F>um</F> which I find a little odd <F>urm</F> because they're just screaming "Welcome.". But as far as service, <SC>I haven't actually been shopping like</SC> <F>well</F> once I asked this lady, I was shopping and I was like, "Where're the pants?" And she like pointed and she said, "Pants <JP>desu</JP>.". So <R>that's my</R> <SC>that's my</SC> that's as far as service has gone for me. But I've heard that if you go into like nice stores, they're very accommodating. Like, I always see people like they'll take your credit card while you're standing there, and they'll go and run to the counter, run to the counter and swipe it and come back to you, which they don't really do in America. So it seems if you're in nicer stores, like in Seibu, like, which has a lot of <F>um</F> like <SC>nice st</SC> nice little stores, like I notice that they seem to <.></.> be giving a very good service. Better than in America.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Because a lot of times, there's service without a smile in America.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>If you go to McDonald's, the people are smiling, in Japan.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>Which is weird to me, because I wouldn't be smiling if I was working at McDonald's. But</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>they are.</B>
<A>But you were smiling when you were working as a waiter.</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>No, but <SC>I had</SC> a <?>see</?></OL> I had fun, but also <SC>you ma</SC> I made an excessive amount of money waiting tables in a nice restaurant. So no matter how hard it was, after four hours, if you make two hundred dollars, <SC>that's <.></.> a lot of</SC> that makes anyone smile, so</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B><OL>yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Sure</OL>. Sure.</A>
<B>And it was a summer job <SC>so it was</SC> and <SC>we could d</SC> and we drank in the bar after work every night. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>At the restaurant's bar. So it was fun.</B>
<A>A lot of people do complain about <R>the</R> the service <R>in</R> in U S stores. <F>Um</F> <R>I</R> I'm not American, but <F>ur</F> for the customer, <F>ur</F> how do you get used to that? <F>Uh</F> <R>is there</R> is there a technique to get used to bad service</A>
<B><F>Well</F></B>
<A>or expect it?</A>
<B><SC>it</SC> I think that's more so in the North than in the South. <F>Um</F> <SC>like in New York, sometim</SC> like in the South, <SC>you never</SC> <SC>yo</SC> <SC>people are smi</SC> like, it's more like Japan. You get better service. People are smiling, like <F>um</F> there's always, you know, "Welcome, come, please sit down.". Like <F>urm</F> but <SC>I</SC> but then, like, you tend to be feisty back to them. <SC>Like if</SC> or a lot of times, if they're being rude, you can just leave, like, be like, "<F>Well</F> I was gonna buy this, but now I'm leaving.". Or tell their manager they're rude and get them fired, <SC>or</SC> but you kind of <SC>meet</SC> butt heads with them. But <SC>that doesn't</SC> that happens more so like when I go to New York <SC>or</SC> not even in <H pn="others13">XXX15</H> so much. <H pn="others13">XXX15</H>. But <F>um</F> like up in the farther <R>north</R> northern regions, that happens more. But I guess you just have to meet them back by being aggressive.</B>

<B><F>Um</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I</SC> <SC>I'm</SC> I just missed my last train to Utrecht and I have to go to Frankfurt tonight because I have to catch a plane tomorrow to fly to Thailand.

<A><F>Well</F> yeah. <SC>But</SC> <F>ur</F> sir, you've missed the train. Basically there's nothing we can do.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> but I paid forty dollars for this train ticket, and I'm not on the train.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> true. But that's not exactly our problem.</A>
<B>Technically it's not, but you could try to help me out because I'm a student,</B>

<B><OL>and <R>I</R></OL> I don't have much money. <SC>And I</SC> <SC>I</SC> <R>and I need</R> and I need your help here.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> true. <F>Ur</F> <R>a</R> any reason for missing this train, <?>perhaps</?>?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> because I was in a cab in Amsterdam, trying to catch a cab from my hostel to here. And the cab got stuck <R>behind a</R> behind a tram that had hit a bike, and we couldn't move anywhere for a really long time. And I should've been on time. I left with plenty of time. But the tram hit the guy on a bike. We couldn't move, and I'm here late. I've missed my train.</B>
<A>You seem to have enough money for cabs, sir. <F>Ur</F> are you sure you're desperate for forty dollars?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> yeah. The cab was only three dollars.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> I see. <F>Uh</F> <F>well</F> <F>um</F> <F>well</F> sir, this is most unusual. <R>And</R> and there's no way that forty dollars is gonna help you with that cab fee.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> that's true. But you could help me out. Let's be nice. The spirit of man. Come on.</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> I'm not paid to necessarily be in the spirit of man, sir. And it's my job.</A>
<B><SC>Ss</SC> <F>uh</F> <SC>ca</SC> <SC>could your</SC> can your manager authorize a refund?</B>
<A><F>Well</F> possibly, but I think it's extremely unlikely.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> we could try.</B>
<A>What if every customer came and pleaded for the spirit of man?</A>
<B>What if, but they don't. So can I talk to your manager?</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> you could, I guess. <F>Urm</F> he'll be back in a while.</A>
<B><F>Ahh</F> I suppose there's a Barnes and Noble across the street.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>

So thankfully, almost everyone in Holland speaks English. So I ran into like the train, like line men, and asked them, "How could I get my bag off this train? It's on its way to Utrecht, where I was supposed to catch the I C E train.". I had a Eurail pass, so it wasn't an issue of paying. But catch the train to Germany, because I had to fly to Asia. And <R>they said that</R> <F>urm</F> <SC>they said that they</SC> O K, so they called the train driver, and he told the conductor to go get the bag and let it off at Utrecht. And thankfully, I caught the next train to Utrecht, and the bag was waiting in the ticket stat <?>in</?> the ticket <.></.> All my stuff was waiting for me in Utrecht, behind the counter. But then I missed my last train <SC>to</SC> straight to Frankfurt, so I had to go to, like, wait four hours to catch a train to Koln, which is the slow train to Koln. And when I got to Koln at like midnight, all the trains in Germany were messed up for some reason and were really late, and I finally got on a train at, like, three-thirty in the morning to Frankfurt, when I should've been there at like eight at night <R>if I had</R> <F>ur</F> if I had <F>ur</F> caught that one little train.

<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> how would you compare the rural scene or the countryside scene <R>in</R> in a place like Kumamoto to that of <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> it's still very crowded, because the majority of the rural land is taken up by not big tracts of personal land, but big tracts of farmland. So <SC>it's just</SC> nevertheless, even though it's in the countryside, the houses <SC>are</SC> still, have very small yards compared to America. And <SC>it</SC> like you imagine the countryside, O K, so things are gonna be spacious. Among those rolling tracts of farmland, still the houses are very close together, and not as big as you would expect there to be if they're in a rural area. Because the rural parts of <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>, the houses are huge and they're on acres of land. And there're maybe farms around, but there's still plenty of land to build your house on. But that's also because Japan is the size of California. And America is <F>well</F> the size of America. So</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F></A>
<B>yeah.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <?>I'm always</?> intrigued. The houses are huge, of course, the land would presumably be cheap. But the <F>ur</F> houses still have to be outfitted</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A>beautifully. <F>Urm</F> if I may ask, where does the wealth come from? <F>Ur</F> <F>ur</F> I'm not familiar <OL>with <?>the area</?></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>In</OL> <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>?</B>
<A>Yeah. You said the houses are huge.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <R>it's also not</R> it's also <F>urm</F> not very expensive to build a big house in the country. <SC>Like</SC> O K, like, for example, the house I stayed <R>in</R>in Uemura <SC>was probably</SC> in square feet, was probably <.></.> maybe a thousand square feet. And they said it costs like three hundred thousand dollars to build. Now, in America, for three hundred thousand dollars in the country, you can build a six-thousand-square-foot house, which is six times the size. So like for a hundred thousand dollars, you can build a two-thousand-square-foot house, which is huge, and put it on a big tract of land, because an acre of land only costs five thousand dollars. So it's like the economies of scale in <SC><H pn="others5">XXX07</H></SC> I mean the South, there's a lot of land, and land is cheaper because it's farmland. And you may have to drive like an hour to get to your job because there's nothing around you. So it's not necessarily desirable to live there, unless, of course, you want to have a big house with a lot of land for not a lot of money. And go through the pain of commuting or whatever.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F>.</A>
<B>So, yeah.</B>
<A>Right. <F>Well</F> Five thousand dollars for an acre of land.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>That's very <laughter>appealing</laughter>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</A>
<B>But then you're in the country, so cows <R>a</R> abound and whatnot.</B>
<A>You need your car and everything.</A>
<B>Yeah, yeah, <OL>yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>, sure.</A>

<A>O K. We're coming to the end of the interview. Now <F>ur</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, what's your schedule like for the rest of the day?</A>

<A><F>Urm</F> probably. I didn't know there was one in Japan.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yeah. But <SC>it's got</SC> it has two people in the office.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>You wouldn't even know that it existed</OL>. But <F>urm</F> yeah, so it does the same things as <SC>the</SC> it protects civil liberties. But I don't do anything. I just sit and read and read and <.></.> sometimes make a copy or two.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F>.</A>
<B>So, yeah.</B>
<A>You're just sort of picking up the atmosphere.</A>
<B>Yeah. Kind of.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. Any plans for the weekend?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> no, not really. Probably go out to a bar on Friday.</B>
<A>O K. And your mother is coming here for Christmas.</A>
<B>Right. <F>Um</F> <F>well</F> <SC>for</SC> yeah, <SC>for</SC> no, she'll be here for the nineteenth, the twentieth, the twenty-first, and then we're going to Vietnam and Cambodia</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>and Thailand.</B>
<A>Spend a</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>lovely vacation.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <OL>Sounds great</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> it'll be nice. I'm looking forward to that.</B>
<A>Sure. Sure. And then coming back to Japan.</A>
<B>No.</B>
<A>You're not. <OL><F>Oh</F> that's it</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>Then we're going</R></OL> then going back to America.</B>
<A>So you've got another month, and then that's it.</A>
<B>Yes. Then I'm done.</B>
<A>O K. O K. <F>Well</F> make sure you use your Japanese when you get back, <OL>otherwise you're gonna lose it</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah, I'll try</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL></A>
<B><OL>I have to take</OL> Japanese class, of course, though.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><SC>It's just</SC> that <F>well</F> after you graduate, you know, <SC>you've</SC> you're gonna lose it if you don't speak it.</A>
<B>I might come back and do JET, but</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>just so that I can keep up my Japanese.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>So that I can pretend that my Japanese wasn't useless.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Yeah. Because you probably don't have much call for it</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>ur</F> back in <SC><H pn="others5">XXX07</H></SC> <F>ur</F> <OL><H pn="others13">XXX15</H> or <H pn="others5">XXX07</H></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Right, <F>well</F> also</OL> when I started taking Japanese, I was under the impression, not being well educated about it <SC>then</SC> it was the eighties. And <SC>the Japan was</SC> Japanese was the language of like business in the world, which now it's Chinese, like, <SC>is</SC> the language like that most kids are taking if they're taking Asian language. It's Chinese. And I was like remembering like the talk of Japan <SC>being like the major econo</SC> I mean, it is a major economy, but still, like, as far as foreign direct investment or business goes, knowing Chinese is a little more useful, currently. But I took Japanese now, <SC>and so</SC> but also, we know English. And I think knowing English allows us to learn a language like Japanese that you can really only speak in one place. Because, like, for example, like, I was reading this article about a Thai guy and an Indian man who communicate in English. And, like, you know, they call their Mongolian partner and they all talk in English. So, like, the world communicates in English. So that can allow us to like learn Japanese</B>
<A><OL>Sure</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>or</OL> another language <OL>like that</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Sure</OL>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Sure. O K. <F>Well</F> I hope you have a great trip with your mother.</A>
<B>Thank you.</B>
<A>Thank you very much for your time <OL>today</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>No problem</OL>. <OL>Thank you</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Thank you</OL> very much.</A>
