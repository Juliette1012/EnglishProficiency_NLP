<B>Otherwise I have dinner alone. And then <F>erm</F> sometimes I rent a movie or it's usually pretty relaxed. <R>I</R> I read a lot, I do my homework, I watch T V. That's about it. Nothing too exciting. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>

<B><laughter><F>Well</F> it's lot safer</laughter>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And <F>erm</F> I've always been interested in Japan. In high school, I took karate for four years. And <R>I</R> I like sushi, and I learned how to tie the kimono, and <R>I w</R> I was really <SC>into it</SC> into the culture. So I decided to come here to learn the language. And I took a few classes in high school</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>erm</F> <R>la</R> language classes. And I thought it'd be nice to come and try something new and exciting. Yeah.</B>
<A>What's so interesting about Japan?</A>
<B>What's so interesting about Japan? It's just exciting for me to come so far away from home</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>across the world for so long. I <R>a</R> and it's just a really interesting experience. What specifically? I don't know. <F>Erm</F> I don't know. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>The language. It's just a totally different experience. I enjoy it.</B>
<A>What is the most difficult thing about Japanese language?</A>
<B>About Japanese language?</B>

<B><F>Hm</F>. <F>Well</F> that I don't really speak it. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>I'm still learning a lot. And there're simple phrases that I wanna say, and it frustrates me that I can't say them. <F>Erm</F> yeah. But in general, it's not so hard yet, because we're just learning <SC>the be</SC> the basics. So it's easy to follow so far.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. O K. <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A>All right. So I think you're pretty busy. But in your free time, what do you usually do?</A>
<B>In my free time, I try to travel a lot, because I know <SC>that I'm not gonna have too much</SC> that I don't have much more time here. Only two more months. So I try to do day trips and go to different places. Like last week, I went to Kamakura.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Just touristy places. But I think it's important to travel. I went to Korea last weekend, which was great. And <SC>I'm</SC> I know that I'm not gonna have the opportunity to go again, so I try to take advantage of.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>If I have free time, I go to parks and museums, and I go to festivals, and just different places, like shopping areas and things. I really try to get out as much as possible</B>
<A><F>Mm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and see everything.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Because I don't have much time. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>I see.</A>

<B><F>Well</F> it's more of like looking. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>Everything's really expensive.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But like I just like to walk through. Everyone's really polite <R>and</R></B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>and it's</OL> clean and <SC>more of an</SC> <SC>I don't</SC> it reminds me of <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>. It reminds me of home. That's why I like it. I just like to walk through. It's very relaxing. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

<B>Sure. I live in an interesting area, because <SC>it's very far away</SC> <R>i</R> it's far enough away from the city to be a very small town. <F>Erm</F> I can't see my neighbors. <SC>I live</SC> <.></.> I'm surrounded by trees <SC>and nothing</SC> <F>uh</F> <R>it's</R> <F>uh</F> <SC>it's a</SC> <SC>I live</SC> it's not rural but it's almost rural. <F>Um</F> and it's an old, small, kind of traditional little town, but it's close enough to the city so that I can go whenever I want, and like <SC>we</SC> <F>eh</F> my friends and family and I go <?>in</?> a lot. <F>Um</F> my town in really small. We have a gas station, and that's it. No supermarket. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>But it's really</SC> <SC>it</SC> but it's very close to another town</B>

<B>which has all these things. I mean, you only drive ten minutes <R>to</R> to get to the supermarket. <R>But</R> but my town itself is really small. <SC>There's</SC> actually, they just built <R>a</R> a very huge, famous shopping center in my town, which is the only thing like of substance. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Um</F> and it's called the <H pn="others8">XXX08</H>.

That's very annoying to <R>ge</R> get off the highway, and whatever but <SC>it's a</SC> it has Gucci and there's all the, like, expensive, like, stores <SC>it's pretty</SC> it's really popular.

<A>Hiroo?</A>

<A><OL>All right</OL>. So <F>er</F> would you mind old place?</A>

<A>So I think you'd like to talk about the apartment you looked for. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>So</OL> what kind of place did you find?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <SC>I found a grea</SC> <F>uh</F> just like I described. <SC>It was</SC> it's a one bedroom. <F>Um</F> there's <R>a</R> a double bed in the bedroom. And then there's a pull-out couch.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So my brother and I can sleep on the foldout couch together. And the women was really nice. She said she would give us a <JP>futon</JP> if I wanted an extra bed.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>You know <SC>the</SC> <nvs>cough</nvs> I think a lot of people move out for the holidays in December, so they had a extra space and they want to fill the rooms.</B>
<A><F>mm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And there's a big shower and a bath and it's great. It's really nice. The kitchen is totally fully stocked with pots and pans and silverware and dishes and everything. And there's a refrigerator and an oven and a stove and a microwave and it's great.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>It's great. And it's in Hiroo. <SC>It's re</SC> it's only like three minutes from the station.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>It's great. I'm really proud of myself. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> It's not a typical way of <F>er</F> Japanese renting an apartment, <OL>I think</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>mm-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>So you <OL>rent only</OL></A>
<B><OL>That's true</OL>.</B>
<A>one month?</A>
<B>Only for a week.</B>
<A>Only for a week?</A>
<B>Yeah. <R>I g</R> I got a week rental. They are advertising by the week, so I found it. I think it's <SC>kind of Am</SC> sort of American-style, because Hiroo is very American, anyway. <CO>But</CO>.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>So <SC>are you</SC> are you excited about your family's coming <OL>to <H pn="others6">XXX07</H></OL>?</A>

<A><F>Mmm</F>.</A>
<B>My family is really excited. My dad wants to ride <JP>Shinkansen</JP>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> He doesn't care where. He just wants to <OL><laughter>ride a <JP>Shinkansen</JP> somewhere</laughter></OL>.</B>

<B><nvs>sniff</nvs> O K. <F>Well</F> <SC>one day last week, I looked in the refrigerator</SC>. <F>Oh</F> no, I'll make a better start. One day last week, I came home from work and I was starving. So I raced for the refrigerator and flung it open, but it was empty. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And I couldn't believe it that I didn't have any food. So I decided that <SC>even though I was tired and it was freezing outside, I would go</SC> <F>oh</F> it's not that cold actually. She's wearing a short skirt, O K, <SC>and it</SC> and it's nice outside. I would go to the supermarket. So I went outside and I got in my little green <laughter>car</laughter> and zipped <laughter>over to the</laughter> supermarket. I opened the door and got out. And I picked up some things from the shelf, and they had my favorite cereal on sale, <R>so</R> so I grabbed that. <R>And</R> and I got some steak, also, for dinner. <nvs>sniff</nvs> And on my way out, I paid the woman at the counter. I loaded everything up into the trunk of my car. <SC>And then I went home</SC>. <F>Oh</F> maybe I bought eggs, I guess. I bought <laughter>eggs</laughter>. And then I went home and fried an egg and ate it, and it was great.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. All right. Thank you.</A>

<A>So <F>er</F> where do you usually buy food in <SC><H pn="others3">XXX04</H></SC> <F>er</F> <H pn="others4">XXX05</H>?</A>
<B><SC>I usually buy food</SC> there's a supermarket <F>er</F> around the corner. <nvs>sniff</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Could you tell me more about the supermarket?</A>
<B>Yeah. I can. <F>Well</F> <SC>there's</SC> <F>erm</F> it's not a very big supermarket compared to American standards. Or even <SC>to</SC> compared to Japanese standards, it's not very big. But <F>erm</F> <F>um</F> food is really expensive in Japan. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Food is very expensive. <F>Um</F> so usually, <R>I buy</R> <F>erm</F> I buy <JP><R>oni</R></JP> <JP>onigiri</JP> for lunch, and I buy yogurt and bread. And I like to look at all the fish. I like to walk around and look at the fish counters because in America, <SC>they</SC> you'd never just have a whole fish just like lying out there. And <F>eh</F> sometimes I <?>like just go to</?>, like, poke the fish.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Erm</F> <laughter><CO>I like</CO></laughter>. Yeah. And I'm <F>er</F> I usually <nvs>sniff</nvs> want to buy some sort of <F>um</F> like <JP>mochi</JP> or sweet or something. But since I'm a vegetarian, I end up having these, like extensive conversations with the people who work there about like if it has <JP>niku</JP> in it, or if it has meat, of if it's vegetarian. And I usually like end up talking to these people forever trying to find out if something has meat. <SC>But</SC> so they all know <OL><laughter>me</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>I'm like the annoying American who doesn't eat meat. But <nvs>laughter</nvs> yeah, that's the supermarket. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K. <SC>So <R>y</R></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>you</SC></OL> but you mentioned you like sushi. <OL><CO>Then</CO></OL>.</A>

<A>Have you seen any difference between American sushi and Japanese sushi?</A>
<B>Not really. <SC>We</SC> <F>erm</F> <F>well</F> they have <JP>toro</JP> here which, in America, we always want it. My dad really likes it, and we always ask for it, but I guess they don't eat it <R>in</R> in America. I don't know why. That's the only difference.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>And maybe price? Price is the same?</A>
<B>I guess they're about the same. It's about the same. <F>Well</F> <SC>it depends on</SC> you know, it depends on where you go, <CO>if you go to a fancy place or</CO>. It's about the same. <F>Oh</F> you know what they have here though, which they don't have in America is <F>um</F> <SC>they</SC> <SC>it's like</SC> it's fish, <F>eh</F> not <JP>ikura</JP> but it's like <SC>b</SC> pink like fish eggs. It's like <R>a</R> <F>uu</F> a clump of fish eggs. Anyway, yeah.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> I see. Yeah. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <SC>They don't</SC> we don't really have that.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
