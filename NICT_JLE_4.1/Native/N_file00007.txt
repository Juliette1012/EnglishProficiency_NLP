<A>O K. Let's begin. So hello. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have your name, please?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. How are you today?</A>
<B>I'm doing well. How are you <laughter><?>too</?></laughter>?</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> Good. Were you about to say something?</A>
<B>No.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> <??></??></OL>.</B>
<A><F>Erm</F>. So how do you like <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B>It's <R>a</R> a fun city. It's really large, though. <F>Um</F> it takes a long time to get from place to place, but I've found it to be a nice place <laughter>to live</laughter> and safe, for <?>the most part</?>.</B>
<A><?>All right</?>. <?>Good</?>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Which part do you like especially?</A>
<B><nvs>sigh</nvs> I don't know if I have a favorite part of <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. There like it just depends on what I want to do. If I want to find something <SC>ni</SC> <F>er</F> electronics, I'll go to Akihabara. If I want, I don't know, to see temples, <SC>I'll go to <SC>different</SC> wherever they are</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> I go to Asakusa or some place like that. I don't know if I have <R>a</R> a favorite, <F>uh</F> like any real, <.></.> like, <R>I</R> I guess, like favorite spots to go or places to go or something <.></.> like that. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. I see. So you like to see temples?</A>
<B>Sometimes. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><laughter>Yeah</laughter></OL>?</A>
<B><OL><laughter>That's just an example</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><laughter><CO>But like <F>hmm</F></CO></laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Well</F> you've been to</OL> <SC>Akihab</SC> <F>er</F> Asakusa, right?</A>
<B>I've been to Asakusa. <CO><R>I've</R> <OL>I've</OL></CO>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. Can you tell me what you saw there?</A>
<B>O K. I saw <F>erm</F> <F>um</F> <F>er</F> <SC>Asakusa</SC> <R>the</R> the temple in Asakusa, and the shopping district around it, as well as the river. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> I believe I even tried to eat there, but couldn't get into a <laughter>restaurant</laughter>.</B>
<A>Why not?</A>
<B>It was full.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><SC><laughter>And</laughter> then</SC> and that's what I did. That's about it. Sorry. <.></.> Yeah. <F>Erm</F> I can't remember a lot of places I went, so that's why I picked Asakusa.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Names are hard.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>O K</R></OL>. O K. So <F>erm</F> you're in a program here. But I don't know much about it. Can you tell me more?</A>
<B>The <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> which stands for <SC><H pn="others2">XXX04</H></SC> <F>well</F> the <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, <F>erm</F> which is an <R>A</R> American program</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>which has different centers abroad.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And each of those centers accept students, and then has a core curriculum <SC>in which people</SC> in which the students will take classes and also other <F>er</F> center-sponsored activities as well. <F>Erm</F> in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, there's three centers in Japan that I know of, here, and <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> and somewhere else that I can't remember</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>at the moment. <F>Erm</F> the center is unique because it has field placement program <SC>and</SC> <SC>which</SC> it allows us to go to field placement every Wednesday <SC>and</SC> in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, <SC>and wor</SC> at a company or at a temple or <F>erm</F> at a <SC>non-profit orga</SC> <R>some</R> some place to get <SC>a</SC> <R>an</R> an extra experience. So you sort of get <R>a</R> a full <F>er</F> view of what life in Japan really is like. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> <R>s</R> <F>mm</F> started, I think, as the Institute for European Studies, so there are many European centers. But they changed it when they went <SC>to more</SC> <R>to</R> <F>oh</F> to other continents. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>To more diverse locations.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So what do you do in your field placement?</A>
<B>I work at <H pn="company name1">XXX06</H>,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>which is <R>the</R> the largest broadcasting network in Japan, and also the one that has cartoons.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>I do</SC> I did research on the video game industry for them <.></.> earlier, and now <SC>I'm researching</SC> I'm doing <R>in</R> in the U S, and then <SC>I'm doing</SC> now, I'm doing the research on <R>the</R> the animation industry in the U S, as well as <R>the</R> the cable and <F>er</F> satellite broadcasting systems as well. <.></.> Yeah. <nvs>cough</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. What's interesting about this industry?</A>
<B>Cartoons. I like cartoons. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>. Right. <OL>So <R>why</R></OL></A>
<B><OL><R>And</R></OL> and games <OL>and stuff</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>why</OL>?</A>
<B>Why? They're fun. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>They're fun for me.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I don't know. And <.></.> I don't know. Every year, I try to go younger. And so <.></.> I don't know. In high school, I was, like, I was too old for Saturday morning cartoons, but in college, I was like, "I'm gonna wake up early and watch Saturday morning cartoons.".</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Because in the U S, we get <OL>Saturday morning cartoons</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>. <F>Uh-huh</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><SC>So</SC> yeah, so <SC>that's</SC> the earliest day I wake up, is Saturday. For cartoons. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K. So tell me about your favorite cartoon.</A>
<B><.></.> Right now, what's my favorite cartoon? <.></.></B>
<A>If you have <OL>to choose one</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><CO>I don't have</CO></OL> <.></.>. I don't know. Maybe right now, it's "Ranma". <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Really?</A>
<B>Which is Japanese.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Very famous Japanese cartoon that, I don't know, involves various people who fall into cursed springs, in <JP>jusenkyo</JP> and become, <F>well</F> in Ranma's case, a girl, and <R>his</R> his father's case, a panda.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter><R>And</R></laughter> <R>and</R> and then, <SC>another girl</SC> <F>er</F> in Shampoo's case, it's a cat. And Ryoga <SC>is</SC> becomes a pig. And Mousse becomes a duck. And <F>well</F> when they get splashed with cold water, they become these things. And <laughter>when and when then they get splashed with warm water, they become normal again</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> All right. So <F>um</F> other than watching cartoons on T V, what do you do in your free time here?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I explore occasionally, and I study a lot. <SC>I don't have</SC> I don't feel like I have that much free time, because I have a lot of work to do. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Erm</F> <.></.> sometimes I go to the movies, which are expensive here, or just hang out and talk with friends.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A>Yeah. O K. So could you describe one person you've met here?</A>
<B><CO>Japanese or other</CO>?</B>
<A>Anyone. A friend <?>that you've made here</?>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <.></.> sure. <F>Er</F> yes. A good friend of mine that I've met is <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>, and she's from <.></.> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>And <SC>she</SC> I met her last March, when I was here right before school began. And she had <F>er</F> <F>er</F> the medical <.></.> exam for school that I guess all Japanese people have to go through every year or something. So we ended up at lunch table together somehow. And so I met her. She's really nice. She <F>er</F> spent a year abroad in the United States, in <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>, which I feel sorry for her, because I don't think inner city <H pn="others5">XXX08</H> is the best example of the United States. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>But she still had a very good time. And we tend to get along very well. <?>I don't know</?>, she's about, <SC>I don't</SC> count how many centimeters, because I'm not Japanese and I think in feet, so I guess maybe five-two or something, which won't make any sense to the people listening to this tape. I'm really sorry. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And, no, she's, I guess, Japanese <SC>which</SC> I guess that fits the rest of description I could possibly say. I can't be like blond hair and blah, blah, blah.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><?>Because</?></OL> like in America, you're like, "<F>Well</F> what's her hair color?". It's like, "Red.". And then, like, in Japan, "What's her hair? ". "It's, you know, like everyone else's.". <CO>And then</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>All right. We're going to move <laughter>on</laughter>. I'm going to show you a picture. <F>Um</F> here's something you might like. <F>Er</F> can you tell me what you see in this picture?</A>
<B>I see someone who doesn't know what he wants. And he's hanging out in the electronics store. And I think he's pointing to a selection of watches. And the store clerk is showing him, I guess, a selection of watches. But then again, I could <laughter><?>be wrong</?></laughter>. It could be the telephone or answering machine or <SC>w</SC> a fax machine underneath. Also in this picture is a T V, a bigger T V, a radio, a bigger radio with C Ds, and something that I don't know what it is, but it looks like it's a T V and a whole stereo system with big, big speakers. And <F>er</F> I don't know how they're gonna move that out of that store, but it might <?>move</?>. It looks like a store. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Oh</F> I bet. And I guess it would be an electronics store, because there're all electronics in this picture, and like C D players and radios and phones and camcorders and cameras. But it could be part of a big department store, in a small section. <F>Erm</F> it's currently three o'clock in the store, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>erm</F> at least according to the wall. I'm guessing that would be three in the afternoon, because no store I know of is opened at three A M, unless it's Wal-Mart. But then again, they close their electronic store at twelve. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>I don't know. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><OL><F>Erm</F> so could you</OL> compare <F>urm</F> <.></.> an electronics store in the States and in Japan? You said you went to Akihabara <OL>here</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. <SC>An electronics store in the States is u</SC> <F>well</F> I guess a great example of electronics store in the U S would be Circuit City or Best Buy, which are <.></.> very big, open spaces <SC>with <R>lots and</R> lots and</SC> <R>they</R> <SC>they keep all their</SC> basically, they keep all their boxes up on top of all the stuff they're displaying. So it's <R>like</R> like walking into a warehouse, whereas in Japan, it's like walking into someone's house, I guess. It's like really small, <laughter>you know</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And like you don't know where they keep all their stuff.</B>
<A><?>Right</?>.</A>
<B><R>And</R> and <SC>it's usually</SC> I don't know, in Akihabara, there're like several floors. <SC>The Laox is</SC> like the Laox in Makuhari, that's a bit more American, except it has two floors. In America, we'd have the same amount of space, except take the top floor out and have the ceiling.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>You know <?>what store</?> it is. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> <SC>we don't</SC> also we don't like to park our cars on top of electronics stores. And we like to park them out front. <CO>And</CO>.</B>
<A><R>Why</R> why is that?</A>
<B>Because we have plenty of parking <laughter></laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>I see, O K</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>All right</OL>.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A><F>Erm</F> the next picture. Describe this.</A>
<B>All right. They're skiing. <F>Erm</F> <SC>it's</SC> <.></.> O K, there are people skiing. There's some guy that's trying to ski downhill backwards. I guess he is an instructor trying to teach people how to ski. And I'm really scared for them, because another person who looks like they don't really know how to ski is gonna run into them. And then there's a person who knows how to ski, and then there's a person who just wiped out. And <R>he</R> <F>er</F> <SC>he jus</SC> he has what we call <R>a</R> a yard sale, where <nvs>laughter</nvs> in skiing, a yard sale is when you wipe out and you lose all your equipment in the <laughter>process</laughter>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> I don't know if that's a complete expression in all of the U S or not. But we use it. And then there's a guy snowboarding. And there's a ski lift and <R>a</R> a ski lodge restaurant sort of thing which has skis and a snowboard <F>oh</F> rack, I guess, <F>er</F> outside. And a snowman, which has only one arm, <F>uh</F> an injured snowman, I guess. And <F>er</F> <.></.> <SC>he</SC> the snowman is made with two big snowballs and a bucket for a hat. And then there's <R>a</R> a big <SC>machi</SC> like, vehicle. I don't know what it is. But it's made for the snow, because it has snow treads on it. And then there are kids playing, or having a snowball fight, which consists of picking up snow, making it into a ball, and then throwing it at someone else, preferably someone you don't like that much. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> O K</OL>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So what sports do you do, if any?</A>
<B>I play squash.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. I see. <F>Erm</F> how did you learn that?</A>
<B>I learned it in high school. And it doesn't involve the vegetable squash, it involves <R>a</R> a small, black ball that doesn't bounce. But you use a tennis racket and hit - <F>uh</F> not a tennis - a squash racket. It's like a tennis racket and a badminton racket <.></.> which doesn't make very much sense. But <SC>if you had <F>uh</F> to pick a</SC> <F>ur</F> if you had to fuse a tennis racket and a badminton racket, you would get a squash racket.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>It's like halfway in between the two. So you use a squash racket. And you use a stroke that's similar to badminton, and you're in a room that's similar to a racquetball room except it's <F>well</F> a court, except it's smaller. Squash has two different sizes of court. They have the international court, which everybody uses. And then there's the American court, because the Americans like to feel special and use their own court, except we don't use it anymore.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> <??></??></OL>.</A>
<B>The international court came first. The Americans made their own court, and then decided that it's silly to have our own court. And we all went to the international court, which is two feet wider and has <?>it's like</?> having a slanted line on the side <SC>that has</SC> <R>i</R> it has stairstepping lines.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And it's a, quite a bit more challenging to play on. Have to be a little more fit. <F>Er</F> squash <SC>is <R>the</R> the second-mo</SC> requires the second-most endurance of any sport in the world behind water polo, which is understandable. <F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>I</SC> if the ball doesn't bounce, then <SC>it's for</SC> you have to do a lot of running. Right? <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Erm</F> <.></.> <R>it</R> its points last on an average of twenty seconds, <SC>which is why</SC> <SC>it's</SC> so <SC>you</SC> basically, it's running for twenty seconds. <SC>In twenty-second <?>interview</?></SC> in <F>er</F> intervals, for about <.></.> a couple of hours in a match. So <SC>that's</SC> <F>well</F> <R>it's</R> it's real hard, when you're good. I'm not. I've never been that good, but I wish I was.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>My university doesn't have squash, so I haven't played very much. And I joined the squash circle here. And it's fun. But they don't really play squash. They sort of go on to a squash court and hit the ball.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B>No rules or anything. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>It's a circle. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. <laughter>O K</laughter>.</A>

</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A>So <SC>we're going to</SC> we're going to do some role-plays now.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>And I'll give you a card and I want you to read it. And <F>er</F> <.></.> when you're ready, let me know.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>May I help you?</A>
<B>Yes. I would like to travel to China on Easter.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F>. <F>Er</F> is Easter important in China?</B>
<A>In China? <F>Mm</F> not really.</A>
<B>No. O K. But I still want to go to China, <F>er</F> preferably, I guess, Shanghai. And I was thinking, you know, the <.></.> like <R>first week in</R> <F>er</F> like, first week in April or so. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> O K.</B>
<A>Yeah. We have several <F>em</F> packages <?>as well as</?> <.></.>.</A>
<B>Is Shanghai pretty in April?</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <?>Pardon</?>.</A>
<B>Is Shanghai pretty in April? <CO>I don't know very</CO>. <F>Eh</F>. <.></.> You know, I <R>haven't</R> <F>er</F> haven't been to China before and I was thinking it'd be <R>a</R> <R>a</R> a pretty neat place to go.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Especially because it's becoming more and more important <F>er</F> to people nowadays. And I'm an economics major, so I was thinking I'd go. And I heard Shanghai was a big economic center. <nvs>sniff</nvs> And <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I think a trip <R>would be</R> would be good. <F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A>Sure. <R>It</R> it should be pretty warm, <R>and</R> and the flowers should be <OL><?>blooming</?> and things like that</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F> flowers are <?>blooming</?></OL>?</B>
<A><CO>So</CO>.</A>
<B>Yeah. <CO>That sounds</CO>.</B>
<A>Pretty.</A>
<B><R>So</R> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> <F>uu</F> so what is the flight availability <SC>to</SC> from <F>er</F> Atlanta to Shanghai?</B>
<A><F>Well</F> there are two flights every day.</A>
<B><CO><F>Erm</F> <F>er</F> what about like on the flights, <SC>do we have</SC> <F>er</F> what classes can I get <R>in the</R> in the prices <??></??> <F>er</F></CO>?</B>
<A>O K. <F>Erm</F>. <F>Well</F> we have all three classes, economy, business, and first class. O K? So I don't know what your budget is.</A>
<B>I have no budget.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. <OL><??></??></OL></A>
<B><OL><F>Er</F> I mean</OL> <SC>I have</SC> budget is not a concern of mine. So <R>I want</R> <SC>I want to stay</SC> <SC>I</SC> so I will fly in first class and I want stay in a very nice hotel in Shanghai.</B>
<A>O K. So we can put a package together. O K?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <SC>what are the</SC> <F>uh</F> I guess I would like also to see some scenic spots and be able to. Is there a sort of a package I can get where I could, like, view the sights around the town <SC>as far as the</SC> and <F>mm</F> possibly even go out to the country <R>and</R> and sort of get a better view <R>of</R> of the countryside?</B>
<A>Sure. Sure. There are some trips that go to different cities.</A>
<B><.></.> And <.></.> O K. <F>Oh</F> that sounds good.</B>
<A>Yeah?</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. So I'll put this all together and I'll send you information. Is that all right?</A>
<B>Yeah. That sounds very good. I'll look forward to the packet.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><OL>Thank you</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Thank you</OL>. So I'll make the reservation. O K. So that's end of the role-play.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. So are you really interested in <F>er</F> going to Shanghai?</A>
<B>I am. <F>Erm</F> I talked to my mom the other night, and she said that I had gotten in the mail this thing that offered to let me go to Shanghai for seventeen days next summer <F>erm</F> for an international business conference or something</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>like that.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>It sounded pretty neat. I've met <F>erm</F> several Chinese people here and they are very nice. And a couple of them live in Shanghai, so I might take the opportunity. Hopefully, they'll be in town and I'll be able to say hi to them. <F>Er</F> also, as I've been in Japan, I've become more and more interested <R>in</R> in seeing the surrounding countries and <OL>seeing more of Asia</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. What do you want to do there, other than go to the conference?</A>
<B>I don't know what's there.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><R>I</R> <.></.> <SC>I jus</SC> <R>it's</R> it's hard to say what I want to do when I don't know very much about <.></.> China or the city of Shanghai. <CO><laughter>So</laughter></CO>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. All right.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A><F>Um</F> and next role-play is this one.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B><F>Hm</F>. I lost my C D player the other day, and <R>I</R> I need to get a new one.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And I need to get one that's cheap.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Because in the U S, I can get one for about ten dollars, or, which is about a thousand yen.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And I was hoping I could get one for about a thousand yen here.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So <SC>what manufacturer's C D</SC> what C D players do you have for a thousand yen, if any?</B>
<A><F>Er</F> I don't think we have any for a thousand yen.</A>
<B>Really?</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> that's too bad. But <F>er</F> what is the cheapest C D player that you have?</B>
<A>Two thousand five hundred yen.</A>
<B><.></.> <OL><laughter></laughter></OL></B>
<A><OL>We have</OL> two types.</A>
<B>Two types?</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. What are the difference between <R>the</R> the two types? The advantages and disadvantages of buying it, or are they the same?</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Well</F> they look similar. But one is waterproof and the other one isn't.</A>
<B>So if I wanted to go scuba diving, the waterproof one.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>How m</SC> <F>eh</F> what depth <SC>does i</SC> is it waterproof to?</B>
<A>You can go fifty feet.</A>
<B>Fifty feet?</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>That's pretty good.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>A waterproof C D player, <?>that goes</?> to fifty feet. I can even use that in the swimming pool.</B>
<A>That's right.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. And so the other one <SC>does</SC> it's not waterproof. Is that the only thing <SC>i</SC> that's different between the two, that one is waterproof and one isn't?</B>
<A><F>Well</F> the other one is scratchproof.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><laughter>Given</laughter> the state of my room, I might want the <laughter>scratchproof one</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Because, I don't know, I tend to lose things and break things, and generally, they fall apart. So if I have one that's scratchproof, and it will always look nice.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>For twenty-five dollars?</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>That's something else.</B>
<A>It's a bargain.</A>
<B>That is a bargain for sure. <SC>So</SC> but I can't scuba dive with it.</B>
<A><laughter>No</laughter>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter><F>Well</F></laughter> that's tough.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Because I do have this scuba diving license that I got when I <laughter>was fourteen</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And, <F>uh</F> <SC>I do</SC> I don't know. I've never thought about listening to <F>mm</F> like, I don't know, J-pop while I scuba dive. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL>. <?>Right</?>.</A>
<B><?>I don't know</?>, I'll take the waterproof one.</B>
<A>O K. Great. So here you are. Thank you very much. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>

<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>erm</F> you listen to J-pop?</A>
<B><laughter>Yes, I do</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <OL>what kind</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>From time</OL> to time. <F>Erm</F></B>
<A><OL><?>What do you listen to</?></OL>?</A>
<B><OL><SC>pop</SC> <R>the</R> <F>erm</F></OL> the J-pop from Japan. <F>Er</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>er</F> Mai Kuraki <SC>is</SC> I like <R>her</R> her <F>er</F> music. And Ayumi Hawasaki and <.></.> Utada Hikaru. <R>It's</R> it's getting harder to say names now.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL><?></?></OL></A>
<B><OL>I don't know the names well</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>But yeah.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I like their music. <R>I</R> <.></.> <SC>I</SC> <SC?>are you</SC?> <F>uh</F> it's the only way I can get new music now anyway. And it's really pretty. I like listening to it. <F>Erm</F> so it tends to get mixed in with all the old music I had from before March, when I was in the <laughter>U S</laughter>. <SC>So</SC> and I don't really notice now that they're speaking Japanese <?>I guess</?>, but I like it. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K. So when you don't understand what they're saying, what do you do? How do you try to understand it?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I like listening to the music. When I was a little kid, and the music was in English, I had no idea what they were saying, and I still liked it. So it's sort of the same thing. You know, that growing down, watching cartoons, listening to music, I have no idea what it means, it's O K.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But <laughter>I do</laughter>, from time to time, open up the booklet and <SC>s</SC> try <laughter><R>to</R></laughter> to see what it says, because it's really nice in Japan, because they put all the lyrics,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>even though it's in <JP>kanji</JP>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But they put all the lyrics <R>in the</R> in the little booklet that comes with the C D. And, though, one of them had <JP><SC>hiragana</SC></JP> <F>er</F> <JP>furigana</JP>. I was so happy.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>It made my day.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><R>And</R> and <SC>I could read, so</SC> I could sort of read it. But I haven't really taken the time to look up every single <JP>kanji</JP> I <F>uu</F> have seen <SC>in the</SC> in all the songs. <SC>But</SC> some of them, I do O K understanding it, for the most part.</B>

<B><OL><CO>Ring</CO></OL>. Hi, <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. <F>Erm</F> I was wondering if you'd like to go to the movies.</B>

<B><F>Erm</F> yeah. O K. <SC>The one's at</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>ho</SC> can you go to <R>IKS</R> IKSPIARI in <F>er</F> at Maihama Station, which is basically the Disney movie theater? Are you free this weekend? <CO>Do I go</CO>.</B>
<A>Yeah. I'm <OL>free</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> how about seeing <F>er</F> "Lilo and Stitch"? Do you wanna see "Lilo and Stitch"?</B>
<A>I'm not sure what that is.</A>
<B>It's a Disney cartoon.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>It's</OL> really, really, really, really good.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And when I was</OL> at home,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>At the U S in August, I watched it three times.</B>
<A><F>Uh</F>. <OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Eh</F> which costs</OL> the same as watching it once in Japan. <OL><CO><laughter>Which is</laughter></CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. If you already watched it, maybe something else <OL>is better</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>No, but it's my</OL> favorite movie of all time.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> <F>oh</F> <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> no</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Have you seen it</OL>? Are you sure?</B>

<B>O K. So O K, I'll meet you <SC>at three at</SC> <F>er</F> actually, <F>er</F> at three o'clock at Maihama Station <F>erm</F> by train. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>I'm not familiar with Maihama Station.</A>
<B>It's on <R>the</R> the Keiyo Line.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Between Tokyo and Soga, which doesn't really help, because every stop on the Keiyo Line is between Tokyo and <laughter>Soga</laughter>.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>Is it a big</OL> <F>erm</F> <OL>station</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>But <R>it's</R></OL> it's big enough, because you can take the rapid.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>And the rapid doesn't stop at every station between Soga and Tokyo. And I don't know where you're coming from, but hopefully you can get to either Tokyo or Soga. And Soga is only, like, two stops from Chiba on another line that <OL>I don't</OL> know of.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>. O K.</A>
<B>And that's like, if you can get to Chiba, you can get anywhere.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Well</F> that's the same with</OL> Tokyo. <CO>So <F>er</F> like</CO>.</B>
<A>I'll manage. <OL>Yeah, thanks</OL>.</A>

<A>O K. So I'll see you on Saturday?</A>
<B>O K.</B>

<followup>
<A>O K. So <F>erm</F> <F>hm</F></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> do you usually go out with friends?</A>
<B>I do. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>All right</OL>.</A>
<B>From time to time. And see movies.</B>
<A>All right. What else?</A>
<B><CO><?>At</?></CO>.</B>
<A><F>Uh</F>.</A>
<B>I've been to too many movie theaters in Japan. And it's gonna make me broke.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Hm</F>. What else do you do <?>with them</?>?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> we go have dinner sometimes. And sometimes we have study sessions <nvs>laughter</nvs> when we have tests. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>And</SC> is that just in Japan? Or can I go to the U S? What do I do with my friends in the U S, is that O K? O K. We have this thing called putt-putt,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>which is miniature</SC> I don't know, I've never seen miniature golf in Japan. But <SC>it's where you</SC> <SC>you get</SC> you know, <F>um</F> with golf, <R>you</R> <R>you</R> you hit the ball and you try to get it into the hole. But at the very end, you have the green, and you hit the ball on the green - from the green into the hole. Basically, putt-putt is only the part with the green. Except, though, they put really strange things in your way, like the Eiffel Tower, or a small version of it, or <SC>a</SC> like a big <.></.> rock or something, so that it's really hard to get from where you start to where the hole is. <F>Er</F> sometimes or even like things like windmills that constantly change so you have to time it. It's sort of fun. And then we also do go-carts. Do you have go-carts in Japan?</B>
<A>I think so.</A>
<B>Really? Cool. O K. Go-carts are fun. They're like cars, except smaller. And you race. And then, yeah. And all kinds of fun stuff. <SC>Sometime</SC> <SC>I</SC> <F>eh</F> here, I've gone to Disney. I can't get my friends to go to a theme park in the U S, <SC>so</SC> but I like going to Disney and riding all <R>the</R> the rides and the roller coasters, though Disney has really bad roller coasters. Because they don't have loops and corkscrews and make you go upside-down.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> I see.</A>
<B>But they're still fun.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. Sure. O K.</A>

<A>let's see. <.></.> O K. Now I'm going to show you some pictures, and I want you to make up a story.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>All right</OL>?</A>
<ctxt>Something drops on the floor.</ctxt>
<A><?>This</?>.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K? And the pictures go this way. And <F>er</F> this happened last week. So please start your story with, "One day last week".</A>
<B>So this <F>erm</F> woman, her name is Meg. <R>She</R> <F>er</F> she went to the department store because she was thinking of how wonderful it would be to <SC>have</SC> get a tie for her husband, Tom, because his birthday was coming up <SC>and</SC> in a couple of days. So she went in, and <R>she</R> <F>er</F> she found the perfect tie and bought it from <R>the</R> the store clerk. And <nvs>sigh</nvs> <F>uh-oh</F> <R>she</R> <.></.> she happened to see the final sale, thirty percent off on the shoes that she'd been eyeing for three months. And she was like, "I know I shouldn't get them. But.". And you know, of course, what happened was Meg got the shoes. And then the next store, <F>er</F> <SC>the next wa</SC> on the way out was fifty percent off <SC>on the</SC> <R>on</R> on the perfect blouse. And that blouse was great because it would go with his tie. And <SC>it had <R>a</R> a matching skir</SC> it had a skirt. And together, it would go with the tie and then they could match on his birthday. <R>And</R> and they could go to the movies. But <SC>she shouldn't get it</SC> she shouldn't spend any more, because she just bought those shoes she'd been eyeing for three months. <R?>She</R?> <R>she</R> she broke down and got them anyway. And then as she went on through the department store, she found more and more things. <SC>And she walked out</SC> as she walked out, she was thinking, "I'm glad this is my husband's credit card.". That's the end of the <OL>story</OL>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> that's good, thank you</OL>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. So you mentioned that she was gonna go celebrate her husband's birthday.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. How do you usually celebrate your birthday?</A>
<B>I don't <laughter>celebrate my birthday, usually</laughter>.</B>
<A>Not at all?</A>
<B>No.</B>
<A>How about your friends?</A>
<B>My friends, sometimes they celebrate their birthdays.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> they'll go have dinner and they'll have cakes and <.></.> I don't know. <F>Erm</F> just they wanna be with their friends. So <R>some</R> sometimes I'm there. Sometimes I don't know about it, and I can't go. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>It's sad. But I like celebrating their birthdays if they wanna celebrate them. But I usually, like this year, I didn't tell anybody, really, when my birthday was. So no one knew, and I just went on like it was a normal day. Had class and had a test.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>No, I had a fake test on my birthday.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>You know what a fake test is?</B>
<A>No.</A>
<B>That's when you're supposed to have a test, but your teacher forgets it. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>So you study all of it, you know, you spend like three hours studying the night before when you could be watching "Ranma One-half" <nvs>laughter</nvs> with your friend who's never seen it before. And you know, so all that time studying and you get to the class, and he forgot it. And it's almost the big letdown, except then you're happy, because you don't have to take a test that day. But then you're not, because then you have to study all over again the next weekend, because you know, between Thursday and Monday, which is the next class, you're gonna forget all those <JP>kanji</JP>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> And so you're gonna have to relearn them on Sunday and it's gonna take another three hours.</B>
<A>It's tough.</A>
<B>Yeah, it's really tough. It was a fake test. <OL>He's done it to us twice</OL>.</B>

<A><OL>So again</OL>, make up a story and start with, "One day last week".</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <.></.> One day last week, <.></.> <F>erm</F> Ted and Molly were walking along, talking, when all the sudden, Ted heard this meowing sound coming from a box, "Meow, meow." <CO>It was like</CO>. And Molly looked over and she went and there was a cat. And Ted does not like cats. In fact, he so doesn't like cats that he's allergic to cats, but he's really not. He just wants to say he's allergic to cats. So he really strongly protested. But he likes Molly way, way too much, and Molly likes cats way, way too much. And so <.></.> they were stuck taking the cat home and he was really unhappy, because he was thinking how allergic he was to cats, but he didn't know what that meant. And so they went home <F>um</F> happily ever after, I guess, with the cat.</B>

<A>O K? Do you have any pets back home?</A>
<B>I have three dogs.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>

<A><F>Oh</F>. Interesting. O K. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> If my dogs liked cats, I might think about liking cats. But they don't like cats. Though my dogs don't like dogs, but I don't really have a problem with the dogs. Just cats.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>I don't know. Something about cats.</B>
<A>You know how they say dogs have their own personalities?</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>How are</OL> the three dogs different?</A>
<B>One is dumb. The other two <laughter>aren't</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><F>Erm</F> we have <nvs>laughter</nvs> our three dogs. And <SC>they're mane</SC> they're named Mine, Storm and Ours. Yes. <F>Well</F> <SC>we</SC> Mine got her name because <SC>my dad claimed that</SC> we had a possessive family, so he named the dog Mine.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So whenever me and my brother'd be in the car and go, "Where's Mine?" he'd be like, "At home." <nvs>laughter</nvs> So <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>er</F> Mine's really smart. And she used to be quite ornery, but now <SC>she jus</SC> <R>she's</R> she's getting a little old. <SC>She's</SC> I think she's about eight. She's a sweetie pie. <nvs>sniff</nvs> And then there's Stormy. Because my brother, <R>he</R> he was really into the weather. He watched the Weather Channel every day and ordered, all the videos. Do you know how many videos the Weather Channel has? Enough to fill up an entire bookshelf.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>You don't want to see <SC>what all</SC> I mean they're, like, "Watch how tornadoes blow down houses," and things like that. You know, it's <?>weather</?>. So he named the dog Storm. <SC>And so we have</SC> and Storm isn't so bright. <F>Erm</F> <SC>we</SC> <R>to</R> to explain this, <SC>we ha</SC> <SC>of our three dogs</SC> <R>we <F>er</F> have a screen</R> <F>uu</F> <F>er</F> we have a screen door and we have a main door in the back.

We <SC>use</SC> goes from glass in the winter, because it's cold, to a screen <R>in the</R> <SC>in the s</SC> <F>mm</F> for the spring and summer. And we're changing it out, so there's nothing. It's a door frame. So two smart dogs go through the door because, you know, it's air. It's just a door frame. And <F>er</F> Stormy, <R>he</R> <F>er</F> he sat outside and whined and had to be let in, because he didn't realize there was no glass in the door. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>I see</laughter></OL>. O K.</A>
<B>But he's really sweet.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>And then there's Ours, which is Mine's puppy. And so because we had the dog named Mine, we'd figured the puppy should be Ours.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>More play on words. And she is ornery and <SC>she</SC> just like her mom used to be, and she fights with her mom all the time. All the time. And, yeah. But <R>she</R> she can be sweet. But she likes to bounce from person to person, because she has lots and lots of energy.</B>
