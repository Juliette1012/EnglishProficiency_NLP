<A>O K. So hello. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have your name, please?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <F>um</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Good to meet you, <OL><H pn="A's name">XXX01</H></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Nice to</OL> meet you, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>Yeah. O K. <F>Erm</F> <F>hm</F> so where are you from?</A>
<B><R>I'm from</R> <F>well</F> I'm from western <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><R>That's</R> that's where my hometown is.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And I spend most of my time <R>in</R> <F>uh</F> in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> where my college <R>is</R></B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>is <??></??></OL>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>So <F>um</F> what's your <F>um</F> university like?</A>
<B>My university. <R>It's</R> <F>um</F> it's a little university.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>It's the <H pn="school name1">XXX05</H>. There's only fourteen hundred students. And it's in an even smaller town, maybe a thousand people. And the town's on top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So, I mean, the school owns almost ten thousand acres.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But most of that is forest and <F>erm</F> mountain walkways. <R>And</R> and there's actually a perimeter trail that's almost twenty-two <laughter>miles <OL>all the way around</laughter></OL> the domain.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>So <R>it's</R> it's really a beautiful campus.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Uh-huh</F>. So what do you study there?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <R>I'm</R> I'm technically a psychology major <OL>right now</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>But when I registered for classes, <F>um</F> yesterday or, no, the day before yesterday, I decided that I was going to switch my major to English.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F> but <R>it's</R> it's really a liberal arts school, <OL>so</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>You know, I think next semester I'm gonna be taking <??></??> <F>um</F> Chaucer, a creative writing seminar, a drawing course, and <F>um</F> <OL><laughter>I don't remember <R?>what</R?> <?>what course I have</laughter> school was</?></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. O K.</A>
<B>And the <?>B A</?> course.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So why are you changing majors?</A>
<B><SC>Psychology is</SC> <F>um</F> psychology, I find, is quite an interesting topic. But psychology is, to me, kind of like philosophy and high school teaching. It's one of those very important professions,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>very legitimate professions that's been almost ruined by most of the people who practice it. And I'm not quite dedicated enough to</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>have to actually fight through and.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <R>that's</R> that's why <??></??>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And <SC?>that</SC?> as for English, <SC>I just always</SC> I do some writing as a hobby. I write as a hobby and <SC>I've been thinking about</SC> I sort of got a dream of about trying to get something published, and maybe make a little money out of that.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><?>Probably</?>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I haven't really made any plans yet.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. So now you're in Japan,</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>um</F></OL> what do you do every day?</A>
<B>Every day? <F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> every day, I usually get up, <SC>have</SC> <F>um</F> sometimes have breakfast with my host family, though I usually get up a little after they do. So I often don't see them in the morning. Start by heading to class. <F>Um</F> go through my classes, usually <.></.> just hang around a bit. <F>Erm</F> that's a weekday. I don't do anything too exciting most weekdays. Weekends, I often go into the city, go into maybe Shinjuku and Harajuku with friends and hang out there with <?>everyone around</?>. <?>Though</?> I started taking, actually three times a week, <JP>aikido</JP> lessons.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I've been doing that a <?>lot of it lately</?>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Could you tell me more about your host family?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> the host family is <F>um</F> <F>well</F> they're a Japanese family. It's <R>a</R> a younger couple, <SC>probably</SC> they're probably thirty-five, about. And their two small children, two daughters aged six and three.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>Which</SC> <F>um</F> they're not very traditional Japanese. <R>We live in</R> we live in a mansion <F>mm</F> in one of the mansions or the apartments. And <F>er</F> the only real Japanese feature of the building to be seen is the one <JP>shoji</JP> screen out on the balcony.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>er</F> <SC>it's</SC> <F>er</F> let's see, <SC>the kids are</SC> the six-year-old <SC>goes to</SC> she is, I guess, a first-year elementary school student. The three-year-old stays home with mom all day. And <F>erm</F> the father goes out and works. I asked him what it is he did, but I didn't really <OL>understand the answer</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><laughter>And <R>so</R></B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>so I'm a little sketchy</laughter>, on what exactly his job is. But <F>erm</F> he goes out, usually gets home moderately late, eight, nine. He got home at ten yesterday. I think that's only moderately late for a Japanese businessman, though. So <F>er</F> and let's see. <SC>It's</SC> I'm not quite as self-sufficient as I usually am. I put my <SC>clo</SC> dirty clothes in the magic <OL>hamper in the <laughter>morning</OL>,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>and in the evening</laughter>, they show up in my room <OL>folded</OL>,</B>
<A><OL><F>Wow</F></OL>.</A>
<B>which I feel kind of bad about sometimes. But</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>sometimes I do the dishes when I sneak into the kitchen <OL>if <F>er</F></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>the mother is chasing after the three-year-old or <OL>something</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. <F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>That's really it.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. Sounds like a nice family.</A>
<B><R>They</R> they really are.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>They really are. <SC>They</SC> <R>the kids get very annoying sometimes</R> the kids get very annoying sometimes. But six- and three-year-old.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I guess they're <OL>almost</OL> supposed to.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Sure</OL>. Sure.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. <F>Well</F> <F>um</F> we're gonna move on. And I'll show you a picture. If you'll describe what you see here.</A>
<B>Sure. <F>Um</F> <F>well</F> it looks like an electronics counter in some sort of department store, probably. <F>Er</F> we've got a <R>younger</R> younger male or <??></??> or maybe female looking, looks like he's asking <SC>questions about</SC> a question about some product on display to a sales clerk standing nearby. He might be pointing at the watches, I'm not sure. But looks like he's talking about just how wonderful the product they're selling is. <F>Er</F> maybe one of the T Vs, I don't exactly know. So he's got a customer interested. And <SC>so</SC> some of the stereos are almost frightening. You know, <R>the s</R> <R>the s</R> the stereo is almost frighteningly large. <laughter>I don't think I've ever seen a stereo <OL>that big in my life</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>But <F>er</F> is there anything specific you'd like me to talk about?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> no. It's O K, yeah. <OL><CO>That's</CO></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><??></??></OL> <??></??>.</B>
<A>Yeah. Thanks. O K.</A>
<B>You're welcome.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Erm</F> all right. So I'm sure you've done some shopping around Tokyo or <OL>this area</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. <F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. Could you tell me about an interesting shop you've walked into?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> let's see. There're all sorts of interesting shops. <F>Um</F> what was it? <R>There's a</R> there's a store in Harajuku <SC>actu</SC> it may I think it's a chains with a lot of locations, I think it has two in Harajuku called either Chicago or Chicago's.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh</F></OL> it's a used clothing store. They sell just all sorts of strange things <F>um</F>. <F>Hm</F> but fairly cheap as far as clothing in Japan goes. And I went in there and bought this odd coat. <SC>It's kind of like</SC> <F>well</F> it's a black wool long coat, and it goes down almost to my ankles. <SC>It's</SC> if you take a trenchcoat and take the sleeves off a trenchcoat and then put a mantle over it,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>it's kind of like that.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><R>I</R> I don't know exactly what it would be called. But I adore long coats. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.</A>
<B>I picked that up. <F>Um</F> what else is there? <R>There's a</R> <nvs>tap</nvs> there's a neat little used bookstore that I stop in occasionally. It's pretty near where I live. It's <F>er</F> just a couple minutes in the other direction from the nearest station to the apartment I'm staying in. And I stop in there occasionally and <F>er</F> pick up some used <JP>manga</JP> or something like it. And <??></??> <.></.>. Probably go some place else. <OL><?>I don't know</?></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Well</F> going back to that coat,</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <OL>yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>erm</F></OL> when you go shopping for clothes,</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>how do you usually decide what do buy?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC>I usually just</SC> I don't normally go shopping for clothes <OL>exactly</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B>But it's more that I'm walking along,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>look at a store, looks like they might have something interesting, I just stop in, pick some things that look attractive, look at them, check the price</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>to see what their price is. Lots of prices here in Japan seem extremely erratic. And, like, as far as I can tell, almost the same shirt from two different stores could be <JP>sen en</JP> or it could be <JP>ni man en</JP>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>But I check the price, try it on, and <F>erm</F> if I like it, I've been indulging myself. <SC>Usu</SC> I worked two summers before I came to Japan for this trip. And I was so good with my paychecks. And <F>um</F> I stopped being <?>good</?> with my paychecks.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <F>Well</F> O K. So you're enjoying that coat?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>I haven't</OL> worn it too often. But <R>I re</R> I really like it, though. <F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Oh</F> too bad I can't see it. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>All right. Next picture. <F>Um</F> if you could describe this. Oops. <?>Right</?>.</A>
<B>Sure. <SC>It's</SC> <F>erm</F> it looks like it's at one of those ski resort places or mountain, I'm thinking a mountain ski resort and you've got people skiing. And <F>um</F> one of those little log cabin buildings nearby that you see in that type of place. There's <F>erm</F> a number of people skiing downhill. Plus one of those lifts that they use to go back up. <R>There's n</R> <F>er</F> there's no one actually on the lift. That's kind of strange. For that matter, this one woman is skiing sideways. I've never been skiing, so maybe that's completely normal, going sideways. Nearby, there are some kids <F>er</F> <SC>with snowballs</SC> throwing snowballs at each other. <R>And</R> <F>um</F> and they look like they're having a grand old time. <SC>I <?>noti</?></SC> I miss snow. Tokyo is a bit warm <R>for my</R> for my liking. I like the cold weather. And <F>er</F> inside the log cabin, up at the top left of the picture, <SC>it looks like</SC> <F>well</F> if I had to guess, it looks like there's a guy and a girl in there flirting with each other over cups of coffee. I could be reading too much into the picture.</B>
<A>O K. All right. <?>Thanks</?>.</A>
<B><?>There you go</?>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So <F>um</F> what were you doing this time of the year last year?</A>
<B>This time of the year last year. What was I doing?</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. Probably <F>er</F> <SC?>I guess the</SC?> <F>ur</F> I guess this time of the year last year, <R>I was</R> <F>um</F> I was doing a lot of drawing, <R>it's a</R> it's a hobby of mine.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>um</F> I actually met this person on line who runs an amateur fiction site. She writes and posts the stories on line. I really like some of her stuff. So I started doing a lot of <??></??> art for her. And we're actually really good friends now. I just got a long e-mail from her. But <F>ur</F> I was doing a lot of drawing. <F>Er</F> probably not studying nearly as much as I should have. And <F>um</F> usually, yeah, especially first semester last year, I went to <F>uh</F> martial arts three or four times a week. So that's probably most of what I was doing. One of my friends, <SC>we were</SC> second semester, I spent a lot of time with her. First semester, she was actually abroad with friends. So she wasn't around this time of year last year.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And beyond that, I guess it just varied from day to day. <F>Urm</F> nothing too <OL>spectacular</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> All right.</A>
</followup>
</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A><F>Um</F> next, we're going to do a couple of role-plays. And I'll give you a card. So if you could read it and let me know when you're ready.</A>
<B>Sure. <nvs>cough</nvs></B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>

<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><R>Ha</R> have you seen the new Harry Potter movie?</B>
<A>Actually, no.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. <F>Er</F> I mean, the first one was really adorable, <OL>so</OL></B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>

<B><F>Oh</F> O K. <F>Well</F> that's <F>er</F> <laughter><R>not</R></laughter> not <??></??>. <F>Well</F> I think you should see the first one sometime. It's <OL>really a</OL> fine movie.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>erm</F> <F>hm</F> <F>hm</F>. O K. <F>Er</F> that's too bad. <SC>I was</SC> but maybe, <?>you know</?>, sometimes we should get together. I mean we'll go to movie and go for coffee or <OL>something</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. But I'd love to watch something.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> O K. <F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> if you're working tonight, <F>er</F> tomorrow?</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B>O K. <SC>Is</SC> <F>er</F> what would you like to see?</B>

<A><F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> I'd like to sleep in. So how about one?</A>
<B>O K. About one. Yeah, I'll see what's showing around then. <F>Erm</F> you want me to pick you up or vice versa, or what would be good for you?</B>
<A><F>Erm</F>.</A>
<B>I think it's a little far to walk.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> Sure. We could meet up at Shinjuku.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Is that O K?</A>
<B>Yeah. <R>Shinjuku</R> Shinjuku is fine with me.</B>
<A>O K.</A>

<A>O K. Sounds good.</A>
<B>O K. <OL><R>I'll</R></OL></B>
<A><OL>All right</OL>.</A>
<B>I'll see you tomorrow.</B>
<A>All right. Thanks for calling.</A>
<B>Good. Bye.</B>
<A>Bye. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><laughter>All right</laughter>. <laughter>That's the end</laughter> of the role-play. Thanks.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Um</F> right. So <F>er</F> you said there wasn't much around near your university.</A>
<B>No, <OL>not much</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>So</OL> how do you and your friends <OL>enjoy your free time</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Well</F> <SC>it's</SC></OL> <F>erm</F> <SC>a lot of ti</SC> the fraternities are pretty popular on campus <SC>because it's</SC> there's quite a mix of fraternities. <SC>I sort of</SC> I'm not actually a fraternity member, but I hang out with the <F>er</F> <?>D K</?> fraternity, which they're kind of <?><SC>the</SC> like ordinary</?> fraternity.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>um</F> <F>er</F> frat parties are pretty big. Beyond that, <SC>just</SC> usually just hanging out in people's rooms, watching movies. <OL><F>Um</F></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B>speaking of role-playing, I never quite got over that like thirteen-year-old <SC>obsess</SC> <F>well</F> not obsession, but like playing Dungeons and Dragons <OL><laughter>and some more games</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>. <F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So I sometimes do some gaming with friends, <R>wat</R> watch movies, <SC>just hang ou</SC> <SC?>there are</SC?> I mean, there's a coffee shop, a few restaurants in town. And like a one-screen theater which airs a new film every week or two. And then it's a half an hour to the nearest Wal-Mart. So that's usually like a trip of three or four people.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><laughter><OL>We get together and</OL> go to Wal-Mart</laughter> for a couple hours.</B>
<A><laughter><F>Wow</F></laughter>.</A>
<B>And you make sure you got everything you need.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And <F>er</F> get on back. <SC>So</SC> and then <SC>sometimes</SC> just sometimes maybe actually making dinner in the dorm's <?></?> kitchen, so maybe make dinner or <SC>most of my</SC> I think I mentioned a few times, I do martial arts, and most of my friends do, too. So I guess it's a sport, basically. Pretty much like any other one. And beyond that, <R>that's</R> <R>that's I think</R> that's I think the bulk of <R>what I</R> what I do</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><?>on the</?> normal days</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. Did you say <?>you were <SC>the</SC> living</?> in a dorm?</A>
<B>Yeah. <OL><R>It's</R> <F>um</F></OL></B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B>it's such a small town. So <F>mm</F> ninety-eight percent of the students live in dorms.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>There are couple apartments for rent in <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>, but just a very few students live in the dorms.</B>
<A>O K. So back in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, you were living with your parents?</A>
<B>Yeah. <SC>When I'm back there for</SC> I usually only go back for the two longer breaks. Spring break and Christmas break, they actually close the dorms. And <F>um</F> this past summer, I actually stayed at <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> working in the computer lab. So I only went home briefly <R?>fo</R?> for maybe three weeks, and then I came to Japan. I think probably this next summer I'll stay at school and work again.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I see. O K.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>So <F>um</F> the next role-play. <F>Um</F> I don't know if you've done this before, but <F>um</F> <?>if you read that</?> and let me know.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>All right? O K. May I help you?</A>

<B>too. So <F>er</F> <SC>do you <R>have</R> have</SC> <F>well</F> <SC>I don't know - what are normal</SC> what do students normally rent if they're looking for an apartment in this area? You know better than <?>I do</?>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> it depends whether you want to live alone or share.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <SC>I have</SC> <F>um</F> <SC>I might</SC> do you think we could maybe get a few examples of both? I haven't found a roommate yet, but <R>there are a couple</R> you know, there are a couple people <R>who I might</R> who I might want to share a room with if they're interested.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. O K. <F>Um</F> we have about three rooms that would be good for sharing.</A>
<B>O K. <SC>How much</SC> what's the monthly rental on those?</B>
<A><F>Um</F> each of you would pay thirty thousand yen.</A>
<B>O K. Thirty thousand yen. <CO>Is that <F>um</F> are utilities on top of that, or</CO>?</B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Um</F> <R>what's</R> what's the nearest station <??></??>?</B>

<B>O K. Maihama, <SC>that's</SC> <F>um</F> which line is that on?</B>
<A>It's on the same line to come to Makuhari, <F>er</F> Keiyo.</A>

<A><F>Um</F> <F>well</F> no. Two bedrooms and a small living room.</A>
<B>O K. O K. Yeah, my friend's got a roommate in this tiny little one-room, but that's in the middle of Shinjuku. So <OL>that's a</OL> little different.</B>

<A>O K. So <F>em</F> back to that topic about living in a dorm. <F>Urm</F> could you compare the difference of lifestyle, living in a dorm and back home?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> living in a dorm and back home. <R>It's</R> <F>um</F> it's kind of peculiar. In a way, I like living in a dorm because I actually have my own space</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>more than I do back home. Because <F>mm</F> my mom collects a lot of things. <laughter>So my room</laughter> sometimes serves as a storehouse.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But my dorm room, I just <?>got <F>er</F></?> like bed, desk and everything else there is mine to do with as I see fit. <F>Er</F> <SC>I don't really mi</SC> I mean, it's a little cramped, but I don't really mind that. <R>It's actually</R> it's actually really nice having other people around sometimes. The noise doesn't bother me. So <laughter>actually, I really like living in a dorm</laughter>. <??></??> And <R>I ge</R> I get along much better with my parents when I'm not living under the same roof.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>We get along much better.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So actually, in a way, I really prefer living in a dorm, <R>especially</R> especially, my freshman year roommate and I got along well. My sophomore year, actually, I was single. Then this summer, I was in a different dorm room where I had a roommate. And <R>that</R> <R>that was</R> <F>er</F> that was <R>special</R> special. <SC>He was j</SC> <SC>he was</SC> <F>um</F> he didn't bathe very often.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And <F>er</F> I remember from my freshman year when I actually met him the first time. I didn't request him as a roommate this summer. We were just assigned. But I met him in my freshman year and I remember him being a fairly bright, witty person. But in the intervening year or so, he seems to have smoked himself retarded.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>So how did you deal with that situation?</A>
<B>I <laughter>don't know</laughter> that I really did anything to deal with that situation. <SC>I just</SC> I didn't spend too much time in the room.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><?>Really</?>.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><SC>It was</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>so I don't know that I'm necessarily a big fan of the</SC> <F>well</F> <F>well</F> I've found some really good roommates there, so I wasn't necessarily a big fan of that roommate.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> I see.</A>
<B>It's not always bad.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>My senior year of high school, I actually roomed with a <F>er</F> Japanese student. <F>Mm</F> <R>he w</R> he was really cool.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>We still keep in touch</B>
<A>Great.</A>

<A>O K?</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>All right. May I help you?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> yeah. <R>I've been</R> I've been thinking about a trip abroad</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>and I've got some</OL> ideas about <SC>where I want to go</SC> <F>er</F> what type of place I want to go to <SC>and</SC></B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>But</OL> I'm not quite sure where, exactly. So I wonder if you might be able to help me out.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> of course. We've got lots of packages and cheap <F>um</F> airfare.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Well</F> <R>I was thinking</R> I was thinking I'd like to visit someplace kind of urban, <?>because I</?> come from a small town. So it'd be a nice change. But <R>maybe not</R> maybe not <SC>without</SC> completely without natural settings. But probably some place fairly urban. <F>Um</F>. If there's a decent number of English speakers, that would be nice. <R>I</R> I mean, I only speak English and, a little bit of Japanese. But <F>um</F> probably someplace like that. <R>I'll be traveling</R> I'll be traveling alone. <OL><??></??></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>I'm traveling alone. And <F>um</F> you know, beyond that, I guess <F>er</F> <SC>that's</SC> do you have any, perhaps, brochures about the <F>well</F> <?>I haven't been too specific</?> yet. Maybe anything springs to mind with just what I've said?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> sure. <F>Um</F> <F>well</F> we've got a bunch for domestic and, you know, foreign destinations.</A>
<B><R>I was thinking</R> I was thinking that I might actually want to go abroad. <OL><SC?>I</SC?></OL></B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B>I haven't been abroad much. So</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>might make for a fun vacation.</B>
<A>All right. <F>Well</F> <F>er</F> English-speaking. How about Singapore?</A>
<B>Singapore?</B>
<A>Yeah. It's quite urban.</A>
<B>That's very true. I see. <F>Well</F> <F>er</F> <F>well</F> what do people usually go to Singapore for? <F>Um</F>.</B>
<A><F>Uhh</F>. <F>Well</F> <.></.> they've got a bunch of <F>er</F> botanical gardens and like safari parks.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>Yeah. <R>That soun</R> that sounds <?>neat</?>. that sounds like a lot of fun. I've been interested in East Asia for a while.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> that might not be a bad idea. Do you have some Singapore brochures?</B>
<A>Of course.</A>
<B>O K. Do you think I could take a few of those to maybe look at?</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Hm</F> let's see. <F>Hm</F> Singapore. Around how much is a round-trip airfare to Singapore?</B>
<A>Just airfare?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A>Would be <F>er</F> six hundred dollars.</A>
<B>O K. And <F>er</F> if I stay for two weeks, around what would I expect to spend on just room and board?</B>
<A><F>Uh</F> at a budget hotel maybe two weeks, <F>ur</F> a thousand dollars.</A>
<B>O K. Two weeks a thousand dollars. O K. Yeah, <R>that</R> <R>that's</R> that's not too bad, actually, particularly for an open vacation.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>O K. Yeah. It sounds like this might be a good thought.</B>
<A>We can start to put a package together for you.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> probably not right here.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I'd like to</OL> <R>take</R> take these and look at them a little longer.</B>

<A><OL>Anywhere</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Yeah. I mean, I won't have much time to travel in Japan <?>because</?> it's been a very busy <OL>semester</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>

<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>after I graduate. And <F>er</F> <R>there are a lot of place</R> there are a lot of places that I'd sort of like to see, but nothing I've got really plans to go to.

<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>There's a lot of things I'd like to see. <SC>I'd like to see some</SC> <SC>I've got</SC> I'm pretty interested in classical Greece. I'd like to see some of the <F>er</F> ruins left there so I get sense of <?>that</?>. <F>Um</F> no plans as of yet.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. O K. Then <F>er</F> could you tell me about the best trip you've ever had?</A>
<B>Best trip I've ever had. <.></.> I think I'm gonna have to call it this trip to Japan, actually. This is really the first time I've ever been abroad. <?>But</?></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>well</F> really to a foreign country unless you count Canada, which most people wouldn't.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <SC>it's been</SC> it's just been a really interesting experience, especially when you <?>have</?> a language barrier. <R>I</R> I can get around, but I'm far short from fluent.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So my days are usually spent on stretching my language capacity to probably as far as it goes before it snaps completely. And sometimes it does snap completely, like when I say things like <JP>korewa</JP> just <JP>chotto</JP> sticky.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>I was talking about <JP>mochi</JP>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. <SC>But it's been</SC> and <SC>I've just seen</SC> I've met some really neat people here and seen some really interesting things.

<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>

<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. One to six. And <nvs>sigh</nvs> this happened before. So if you could start your story with "One day last week". <OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>. <F>Well</F> one day last week, <F>er</F> Bill and Jane were walking back home from school in the rain. <R>It was</R> <F>well</F> it was raining. But the temperature was fairly pleasant and they were having a nice little conversation. They'd been friends for a long time. And <F>ur</F> Bill thought he heard something, a sort of <F>mm</F> plaintive mewing sound, and wasn't quite sure what it was. But then Jane realized it was coming from this just random cardboard box lying on the side of the road. She looked in there, and she found this poor, soaking wet, draggled kitten. No collar or tags or anything. And just trying to figure out what to do with it. And asked Bill and <??></??> he goes like, "No, no, no, no. I can't take that thing home. My mom's <?>working</?> and my dad's allergic to cats, <?>only smell of them</?> and he hates cats. That'd be a mess. <F>Well</F> <F>er</F> I mean it's a little lost kitten like soaking in the rain.". <R>Jane just</R> <F>oh</F> Jane just loves this thing. So trying to figure out what to do with it. I mean Bill, <R>he</R> he's always claiming not to like cats. But, you know, he is just <?>in touch with</?> <??></??></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>It's a</OL> poor little lost kitten. So what they finally decide to do was that somehow they're going to find a way to keep it. But <SC?>in</SC?> first, they're going to <F>er</F> <F>um</F> put up a few <?>posts</?> to make sure that no one has actually lost this thing, and it doesn't actually have tags or anything like that.

<B><F>Oh</F> yes.

So they <F>er</F> go out looking around town. And Carl sees a restaurant that he's been meaning to try possibly, and points over and says, "Hey, what do you think of that place?" And Professor Benson's like, "Whatever you like. It's your decision.". So they <F>er</F> go in. <F>Er</F> they are seated at a table by a waiter there, take a look at the menu. <R>Looks like a</R> looks like a pretty nice setup. A little expensive. It's actually paid for in the faculty budget. So <F>er</F> Professor Benson does not <?>mind in the least</?>. <SC>They</SC> <F>er</F> <F>well</F> maybe the meal goes quite pleasantly. They talk about many things besides psychology, comprehensive exam. It's sort of a <?>rule that they would</?> actually do that. Yeah. Sit down, have a nice meal, chicken, fish, have a few beers together, and <F>er</F> talk about what <F>er</F> Carl's planning on doing after graduation. <SC>They</SC> <F>er</F> Professor Benson has the bill sent back to the accounting department, which <SC?>is</SC?> the practice.
