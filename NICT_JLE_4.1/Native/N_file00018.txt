<stage1>
<A>Hello. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have your name for the record?</A>
<B>My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>Nice to meet you.</A>
<B>Nice to meet you.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. So <F>er</F> where are you from?</A>
<B>I'm from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. O K. Can you tell me about the area you live in?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I'm actually not from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>I'm from <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> which is,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I guess, it's about forty minutes southeast of <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, really.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> it's kind of a suburb. <R>It's</R> <F>er</F> it's in the heart of what, I guess, is referred to as <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <.></.> it's a <R>nice</R> nice town. There's two high schools, <F>erm</F> movie theaters, just kind of a <R>standard</R> standard suburb.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>It's nice so I enjoy it.</B>
<A>So what brings you here?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> studying Japanese <laughter>mostly</laughter>,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Japanese culture and mostly Japanese language more than anything.</B>
<A>What do you find interesting about Japan?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> honestly, I didn't think I'd do that much when I was <OL>doing my</OL> application.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>. <F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I had come here <SC>in junior high school</SC> at the end of junior high school, so between eighth and ninth grade,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and I did a home stay for two weeks in <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> <JP>ken</JP>. And <F>er</F> I had a really good time. And everybody was really nice and friendly and really welcoming. So when I was looking for a place to study abroad, I figured that this might be a cool place to come.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So that's why I came back.</B>
<A>O K. So are you enjoying the classes here?</A>
<B>The classes?</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> Yeah.</A>
<B>The classes, not so much. I really enjoy <F>erm</F> <SC>my life</SC> my daily life with my host family</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>and <F>er</F> my field placement sometimes where I go and do work with <H pn="company name1">XXX08</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> the classes,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><R>they're ve</R> they're very different from what I'm used to back home <OL>in America</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>. <OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> O K. <SC>S</SC> <F>um</F> <.></.> and so what do you do at that field placement?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> it's kind of interesting. Half the time, I do probably the most banal office work <OL>you could imagine</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>I just Xerox stuff and I collate stuff and basic kinda intern stuff.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And then the other half the time though, <SC>I get to</SC> <R>the</R> the <H pn="company name1">XXX08</H> puts together these programs for visiting international delegates</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>from other countries. So for instance, yesterday, there was a group of about thirty Chinese people that were visiting Japan under the auspice of some youth exchange program. And we got to go to Koizumi's office in the L D P building, look around there. We went and did a tea ceremony. And after that, we went to a dinner in Akasaka and <F>er</F> drank a little, ate a little <JP>yakitori</JP> and the Chinese people were getting up and sing songs, you know, just <?>belting it out</?>. It was <OL>really cool</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>So, yeah, it's fun.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. So in your free time, <F>um</F> do you hung out with friends?</A>
<B>Here?</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> most of the time, I hung out with my host family <OL>actually</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><SC>Which</SC> I guess, they are friends.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Erm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>What are</OL> they like?</A>
<B>There's my host mother, my host father <SC>both of which are</SC> both of whom, I think, are <SC>around <R>thirty</R> thirty something</SC></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>just a little over thirty. And there're three kids. There's a five-year-old, a three-year-old and a one-year-old.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <SC>things around the house are very interes</SC> they're always busy.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>You know, <SC>it's</SC></OL> there's never any downtime. It's always exciting,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>playing with the</OL> kids and stuff. So that's fun.</B>
<A>O K. So <F>um</F> can you describe your room or <F>um</F> apartment that you live?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> my room has <.></.> <nvs>laughter</nvs> a bed that's pretty low to the ground. <F>Erm</F> I have three really thick sheets on it because the house has no central heating.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So it's freezing when I eat in there and freezing when I wake up in the morning. But I got three really heavy blankets. <F>Erm</F> there's a desk in one corner with <F>er</F> a lamp on it, and all of my stuff piled on top because there's no real storage space to speak of. <F>Erm</F> there's a stereo sitting next to the desk, C D player, some outlets that usually have <F>er</F> <SC>the</SC> my C D battery charger or my cell phone battery charger plugged in. There's a closet right in front of the bed. And in front of the closet, I usually have piles of my dirty laundry</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>or the laundry that just been cleaned and is now waiting to be put back into the closet. And all of my personal stuff like shower stuff, like tooth paste, stuff like that.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. So you listen to a lot of music?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> yeah.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Yeah. But my commute takes about an hour each direction,</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>so I find myself on the trains a lot, because I'm <SC>switching</SC> transferring in the stations and stuff. I can't really do homework or anything because there's too much interruption. But I can listen to music pretty comfortably.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So actually bought a C D player about a week or two after I got here.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> I've just been bumming C Ds off the friends. So</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>yeah, I do listen <laughter>a lot</laughter>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> What kinds of music?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> pretty much just whatever comes my way. Like my host parents had a copy of Stevie Wonder's "Greatest Hits"</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>which I never really listened to that</OL> much before. But I developed a pretty strong taste for it after listening to it for a few weeks.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> my cousin sent me kind of a random, folky kind of C D. <F>Er</F> I just borrowed the Beatles from somebody the other day, and my friend just lend me a trance C D, <F>er</F> electronic <??></??>. And I'm enjoying them now. So</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>pretty much anything.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. I see.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. <F>Well</F> I'm gonna show you some pictures now. And <?>this one is the first one</?>. Describe what you see here.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> it looks like a ski slope. There's <F>er</F> one, two, three, four, five skiers or six, but one of them is taking a spill and he's missing one of his skis and poles. There's a snowboarder at the top of the mountain. There's a child lift on the right. <F>Erm</F> there's a mountain in the background, and some kids having a snowball fight in the foreground on the left. <F>Erm</F> there's a snowman next to, I guess, it's a cat. It's not really snow, powder snow. <?>Crowdy</?> on the front of it. <F>Erm</F> there's a lodge. There's some people that look like they've got a mug of coffee or hot chocolate or something. <F>Erm</F> and right next to the lodge, there's like a ski and snowboard stand, and a mound of snow behind that. And one of the guys is on the other skis. He's a little chubby. He's wearing an orange bib. <F>Erm</F> there's a woman next to him who is not as chubby and is wearing an orange bib. She's in red. She's got pink boots with the <?>lower end</?> buckles, they're cute. <F>Erm</F> in the very front lower right, there's a guy with big ear muffs on. And <SC>his back is</SC> can't see his front, it's just his back. He's got one hand in the air, and he's wearing a jersey with a white C in the back and a fanny pack. <F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. <?>I think it's enough</?>. <OL>Thank you</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><?>Was that any good</?></OL>?</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. So do you do any sports?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> play soccer, <?>inchmeal</?> soccer back in the States, and American football, flag football, and kayak, I might run every morning, and sail. I was on a sailing team. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Wow</F></OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> You do a lot. O K. <F>Um</F> I don't really know what "flag football" is. <SC>Could you <??></??> tell me about it</SC> or actually, what's the difference between that and regular football?</A>
<B>The difference between flag football and normal football is, <F>oh</F> I guess, <?>first of all</?>, it's kind of a peculiarity of United States English that, unlike everywhere else in the world, word "football" actually means football. <F>Erm</F> in the United States, it's not at all played with the feet. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>It's, you know, <R>the</R> the American football.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So flag football versus normal football, the difference is, in normal American football, in order to end a play, someone's usually tackled or is knocked down physically whereas with flag football, you're wearing a belt with a bunch of flags ringed around it. And instead of knocking other person over and tackling them, you just have to pull one of the flags off, and that ends the play. So it's a lot less dangerous, I guess. Hurts less.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. So <F>um</F> why do you like it so much?</A>
<B>Flag football?</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> it's a really good way to get out and have fun with your friends. <SC>It's</SC> <F>erm</F> you know, it's energetic, <SC>it's</SC> <.></.> you know, <.></.> it's athletic.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Something to do on the weekend. <R>It's</R> it's easy. All you need is a ball and couple of flag belts and there's not like a lot of equipment or pads or anything. <F>Erm</F> and it's not like really hugely competitive like it's just kinda for fun.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. O K.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>Next picture is this one. Describe <?>what's in it</?>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> it looks like a <R>e</R> electronic store.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>There's a guy in a green jacket with a name tag on. And it looks like he's gesturing to a customer who's wearing <F>well</F> looks like a denim jacket and <F>er</F> some kind of cuffed pants, like jeans or something. <F>Erm</F> customer has his left hand in the air, and he's got his finger pointed at something, maybe the salesperson. <F>Erm</F> behind them, there's glass cases filled with telephones and video cameras and there're more photographic cameras. And on top of the display cases, there are televisions, <F>erm</F> and big sound systems, the speakers and dials and cassettes and all that kind of stuff. And on the back of the wall, there's a clock that reads three o'clock.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Are you usually a careful shopper?</A>
<B>No. <OL>Not at all</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><R>I'm not much of a</R> I'm not much of a shopper <OL>really</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>. O K.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>. But when you have to buy something, <F>er</F> let's say, it's really expensive,</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Erm</F></B>
<A>what do you consider?</A>
<B>I guess if I know I'm gonna have to buy something expensive, <SC>I try and</SC> I guess I'll look into it a little bit, I try and make sure I don't just buy <F>er</F> something that's gonna break, you know, <?>almost</?> I look for durability and quality. Like I'll look for reviews and I'll ask my friends who'd bought something similar what they think of, you know, whatever they've got, that kind of thing. So <.></.> yeah. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. Have you had any troubles here</A>
<B>With like <OL>stuff I bought</OL>?</B>
<A>with <OL>stuff that you bought here</OL>?</A>
<B>Not really. I haven't bought anything.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Except for that</OL> C D player.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>It's holding up really well. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>. <F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>It's only been two months so I would hope so.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. <F>Um</F> where did you buy that C D player?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> to be honest, I don't know the name of the store. My host parents were just driving around with me one day, and <F>er</F> we stopped in some place. I thought that might be a good idea to get one. And I got it there. It was kind of in and all-purpose department store with a bunch of floors, you know. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
</followup>
</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A>All right. So now, we're going to do <?>with you</?> role-plays. All right?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>And I'll give you a card. If you could read it. And let me know when you're ready.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K? May I help you?</A>
<B>Yeah. I'm trying to get to New York.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And I was wondering when the next train is and how much it costs.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> the next one is leaving in fifteen minutes.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. And it's fifty dollars one way.</A>
<B>O K. And what platform is that leaving from?</B>
<A>Fifteen.</A>
<B>Okey-dokey. Can I have one ticket, please?</B>
<A><laughter>Sure</laughter>.</A>
<B>Thank you very much.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Um</F> <OL>actually</OL>,</A>
<B><OL><??></??></OL></B>
<A>the next train is all booked.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <OL>I'm sorry</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> when's the first available ticket that you have?</B>
<A>And the one after that which leaves in about twenty-five minutes. <OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Can I</OL> get a ticket for that?</B>
<A><laughter>O K</laughter>.</A>
<B>Do you accept credit cards?</B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B>Fantastic.</B>
<A>O K. So here's one ticket.</A>
<B>Thank you.</B>
<A>Nice trip. That's the end of this role-play.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. <F>Um</F> so when you go to places outside of Tokyo,</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>how do you usually go there?</A>
<B>Usually by train. In fact, always <laughter>by train</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Have you had any troubles getting around?</A>
<B>Not really. <F>Erm</F> usually if it's somewhere like really remote, I would talk to somebody either here or my host parents or whoever I'm going to meet in that location. And I'll ask how to get there basically. So they'll tell me what stations I need to transfer at and what lines I need to take. And <F>er</F> that one is just a matter of following the directions. <OL>So</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>it's pretty simple.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. How about when you were in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>?</A>
<B>I always drove.</B>
<A><F>Huh</F>.</A>
<B>I haven't really ridden a train.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><?>It's quite</?> <??></??></OL>. So yeah.</B>
<A>All right. Do you find that one is more convenient than the other?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><?>Yeah</?>?</A>
<B>Yeah. Certainly. <F>Erm</F> one of the things I miss the most is actually being able to drive, <OL>you know</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B>Just to have enough freedom of being able to go anywhere you want, <OL>whatever you want</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><F>Erm</F> through the weekend, we went clubbing in Shibuya. And the trains stop running at twelve.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So at that point, you're out</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>until six in the morning,</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>which kinda sucks.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</A>
<B>It'd be nice to be able to drive <OL>and get back</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Sure</OL>.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>So what did you do after trains had stopped?</A>
<B>We just had to wait. We just went into a Yoshinoya and sat down. And killed time for couple hours <?>before</?> the trains started up again.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
</followup>
<task>
<A>All right. The next role-play is <F>er</F> this one.</A>
<B><??></??>.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Ready?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> O K. May I help you?</A>
<B>Yeah. <R>I'm</R> <F>er</F> I'm planning a trip abroad. I'm taking some time off from work. <F>Erm</F> and I've got an idea about the holiday but I don't really know where to go.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I'm kind of looking for a tropical vacation. Do you have any packages or any deals that you offer that I might be able to like get in on?</B>
<A>Sure. Of course we have lots of packages.</A>
<B>What can you suggest?</B>
<A>Tropical islands, <OL>did you say</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Tropical islands</OL>, <OL>yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. <F>Um</F> how about Tahiti?</A>
<B>Tahiti?</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>How much would that cost? And how long would it be for?</B>
<A>Right. <F>Um</F> just airfare?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> airfare and stay <SC?>accom</SC?></B>
<A>O K. All together?</A>
<B>with room and board, yeah.</B>
<A>Yeah. <F>Well</F> for <F>er</F> five nights, six days, it would be twelve hundred dollars.</A>
<B>Five nights, six days, twelve hundred dollars. O K. Do you have any other, maybe, less expensive options?</B>
<A>O K. <F>Er</F> maybe Guam would be cheaper.</A>
<B>Guam?</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>?</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><F>Er</F> how are the accommodations on Guam?</B>
<A><F>Er</F> <F>well</F> there're budget hotels. So that's why the cost would be cheap.</A>
<B>And how much would it cost for about a week?</B>
<A>About a week? <F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>With airfare?</B>
<A>Right. About eight-fifty.</A>
<B>Eight-fifty?</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> that sounds pretty good.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> what would it take to make reservations for that?</B>
<A><F>Um</F> <F>well</F> you just have to let me know two weeks prior to departure.</A>
<B>O K. Good deal. <F>Erm</F> may I have your phone numbers so that I can give you a call back later?</B>
<A>Sure. <SC?>Is</SC?> here is my card. and you could call me back. O K?</A>
<B>All right. Thank you very much.</B>
<A>All right. Thanks. <??></??> this role-play.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. So <F>um</F> when you decide to travel, how do you usually plan your trips?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> actually I'm in the middle of that right now.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Actually</OL> I'm trying to figure out what I'm gonna do this coming spring semester</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL></A>
<B><OL>because</OL> I'm gonna take it off from school.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>erm</F> when you're a kid, you kind of take it all for granted, you know, like your parents plan <OL>everything and you're like</OL>,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>"<F>Oh</F> this is easy.". You just go somewhere.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But now I'm finding a lot harder. I guess what I've been trying to do is the least planning possible. So for instance, <F>erm</F> I know I wanna go to New Zealand.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I think I might just go to New Zealand and rent a car and just drive around, basically. And, you know, hike and just go see whatever sights I can and not make a whole lot of arrangements with hotels and stuff that I <??></??>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I guess I kind of opt out <laughter>of making</laughter> travel plans,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>basically, like I just try and get somewhere</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and give myself whatever I need to get around that location.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><?>That makes</?> more interesting. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Yeah, <OL>maybe</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B>We'll <laughter>see</laughter>.</B>
<A>All right. So <F>um</F> if you don't mind, why did you decide <SC>not to</SC> <F>well</F> to take time out from school?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <.></.> I had some credits going inter school.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So that I've got that leeway where it's not gonna mean I won't graduate with my class. <OL>And</OL></B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><F>um</F> got some money I saved up from working a couple of summers. So I've got the money to do it. And <F>erm</F> I figured that there're not gonna be a whole lot of other opportunities, you know, to just travel around for four or five months without any responsibilities. So might as well take <?>value</?> about it.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> I see. O K.</A>
</followup>
<task>
</task>
<A>O K. Now the last role-play. Saying you're not much of a shopper, but <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><?>let's</?> do that.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>Yeah. <R>I'm</R> <F>er</F> I'm looking for some oatmeal. <SC>Do you like</SC> do you guys carry oatmeal?</B>
<A><nvs>sigh</nvs> Yes.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> what kind of oatmeal do you have here? Do you have Quaker? Do you have rolled oats?</B>
<A>We have both.</A>
<B><F>Wow</F>. O K. And where can I find those? What aisle is that on?</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> number ten.</A>
<B>Aisle number ten.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>Do you have a whole lot of flavors, you know, like cinnamon raisin and stuff or you only have the plain kind?</B>
<A>No, we have a whole range of <F>er</F> flavors. And we also have like the natural type without <F>er</F> leached oats.</A>
<B>Without leached oats?</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Fantastic. <F>Erm</F> great. And do you sell in <?>oak</?> or do you just have <R>the</R> the small packages?</B>
<A>Actually, <SC>there're</SC> some are on sale now. So if you buy three of them, you get one more free.</A>
<B>Fantastic. Is there any limit to the amount I could buy? Like if I buy six, do I get two free?</B>
<A>Actually you do.</A>
<B>Fantastic.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>Then <F>erm</F> I'm just gonna go easy on over there and get those oats. Thank you very much <OL>for your help</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. Sure. <?>Spend time at</?> <nvs>laughter</nvs> Oatmeal, all right?</A>
<followup>
<A><F>Um</F> I'm sure you don't have oatmeal while you're here.</A>
<B>Actually, I've been eating it everything for <OL>lunch for about</OL> a week.</B>
<A><OL>You're kidding</OL>. Really?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. I <laughter>see</laughter>.</A>
<B><OL><laughter>So it's <??></??></laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter>Is there a reason</laughter> why?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I really like oatmeal.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>That's it, basically. <F>Oh</F> and it's cheap in the cafeteria here and <F>er</F> it's kind of good food when it's really cold out outside. And the hot water dispensers which they make are really convenient. You know, they have tea machines</B>
<A>Right, right.</A>
<B>with the <JP>ocha</JP> and the hot water and the cold water, makes it really easy.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So yeah. It's kind of sad, but I'll be leaving them, you know.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Uh-huh</F>. <F>Hm</F>. How are you enjoying Japanese food?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> it's good. It's really different. <F>Erm</F> even beyond just like the obvious differences like we don't eat so much <JP>soba</JP> or <JP>udon</JP> in the United States, there're just like interesting ways that food is prepared. Like for instance, fruit always seems like it's peeled, like apples or <JP><SC>nashi</SC></JP> the apple-pears or <F>erm</F> grapes, even, are always peeled. And then in United States, that's not so much the case. Whereas with meat, for instance, chicken, when you go to like <JP>yakitori</JP> or something, they have big strips of fatty skin just hanging off that <??></??>. And <F>er</F> in the United States, it's always clipped off there. So it's interesting that, for instance, food is peeled whereas chicken fat isn't. And in the United States, we don't peel the fruit so much.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And then I guess <?>there're</?> the obvious like reasons for that like in each culture. Like my host mother was telling me that <F>erm</F> I guess there were some problems with like parasites or contaminations on the fruit fields back, so they started really heavily waxing some of the fruit. So if you just eat it straight, then it's probably not such a good call. So it make sense <R>to</R> to peel it in this context. But anyway, I'm doing a food <OL><laughter>journal</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> O K. All right.</A>
<B>The food's good.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. In general, when you are served something that you're not quite crazy about,</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>um</F> how do you deal with it? <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>I pretty much always <.></.> <SC>eat some of it</SC></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>just <F>er</F> eat some of it,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>and then if I really, really don't like it, I just don't finish it, like I don't eat all of it.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> for instance, when I was in Kyushu, they had us eat raw horse liver.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But <R>they</R> they realized that it was something that we didn't usually eat, so they weren't really expecting me</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>just <R>to</R> <F>er</F> to down the whole plate by myself. I think it's <?>only</?> to give you an experience of trying it.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I tried it, and I had a piece or two. And then, that was it.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> yeah, I generally try new stuff. And sometimes that actually works out pretty well. Like when I first got here, one of the first breakfast I had was <JP>natoo</JP>, the fermented soy beans, which is <?>tough or little</?> shock to western <?>diet</?>. <SC>And</SC> <F>er</F> but in Kyushu, again, I was served those for breakfast one morning. I found that I actually didn't dislike them.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And so over a week, I just kept eating and I kept eating and now I actually enjoy them. So I just kinda stick with it until I had to get used to it or pass up. <laughter><CO>So</CO></laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>By the way, what's raw horse liver like? <nvs>laughter</nvs> I've never had it.</A>
<B>It's <F>er</F> <JP>omoshiroi</JP>. <laughter><R>It's</R></laughter></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><SC>it's really</OL> kinda</SC> <nvs>tsk</nvs> it's not crispy, but like you bite into it and there's like a little crunch</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>and <F>er</F> it's kinda sweet, almost. <R>It's</R> it's a lot different than like chicken livers, <?>I think</?> it's kind of tough.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><R>It's</R> <F>er</F> it's not bad. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> O K.</A>

<task>
<A>Now in final stage, I'll show you some pictures and I'd like you to make up a story. <??></??> <F>Um</F> pictures go this way, and this happened last week. So if you could start your story with "One day last week".</A>
<B>One day last week, <F>er</F> Jim and Christine were out for a walk. And it was raining, so they brought their umbrellas with them. And they were walking and talking. And suddenly Jim heard a noise, and it sounded like a cat meowing. So he turned around, and there lying in front of the telephone post was a box. And he opened up the box, and Christine took a small cat from inside the box. And she asked him if they could keep it. But he was really opposed to the idea, that wasn't enough for them in the apartment, she just had a baby, thought they'd be really busy, plus there's like disease that cats carry that sometimes infects babies and they die. And he thought it'd be really bad <?>scene</?> if they kept the cat. But Christine's really affectionate towards the cat and seemed like she loved the cat a lot, so Jim's kind of confused and didn't know what to do, <F>erm</F> to take the baby or the cat. And in the end, he decided that it would probably work out O K if they brought the cat home. So they walked home in the rain with the cat.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Do you have any pets back home?</A>
<B>I had a cat until about a year and a half ago.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> then he died.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And he was diabetic, which I didn't even know that cats could get.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> what else? <F>Oh</F> when he was incontinent, <SC>so he would</SC> <SC>he even</SC> we let him inside the house. He would just go buck wild and he <?>ate</?> up everything. So ultimately he became a outdoors cat, which was kinda a sad deal. But I think he still had a good time as far as cats go.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. When you found out that <F>um</F> he had diabetes,</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>how did you have to take care of him?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> basically, we didn't really change our treatment on him or we didn't really give him any shots or anything. <F>Erm</F> I think we changed the cat food that we were feeding him. But other than that, we really didn't have to do anything too crazy. He <R>lost</R> lost a lot of weight. But otherwise seemed to be pretty good up until when he died.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <??></??> By the way, I didn't ask you about your family. <F>Um</F> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>I asked you about your host family. But <F>um</F></A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>can you tell me a little bit about them?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> my dad is fifty something.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> my mom is fifty something, too.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And they own a small internet publishing company</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>in <H pn="others6">XXX09</H> which is strictly <??></??> in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. It's about a four-minute commute from the house, which is nice for them, I imagine, seeing as how my host father here deals his an hour and a half commuting to Tokyo everyday. So they're lucky for that. <F>Erm</F> my sister goes to school at <H pn="others7">XXX10</H>, which is an all-girls college in <H pn="others8">XXX11</H>. <F>Erm</F> she is twenty-one. And she'll be graduating this coming spring. She is a math and economics major. <F>Erm</F> and two days ago, she got into a car accident where their car tire blew out. And she rolled the car into the median strip. But she ended up with just a cut under her nose even though the car was totaled. And she's O K, so that's good.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So what did your parents say when <F>um</F> you said you wanna go to Japan?</A>
<B>Not much. They didn't have a whole lot of input, really,</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><?>to it</?></OL>. I mean they were supportive,</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>but just</OL> <.></.> yeah, <SC?>they didn't</SC?> <F>um</F> <SC>they've only been here</SC> <F>er</F> they've only been to Japan once. <F>Erm</F> they had some kind of sailing match in Kamakura.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So they had a really good time there. And I think they stayed at like a <JP>ryokan</JP> or something. And <F>er</F> really enjoyed themselves.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So they were only here for, I guess, <F>oh</F> would've been like a long weekend or something. But they really didn't have that much to say about it, you know. They knew it was interesting. My sister has been here two or three times herself, and I'd come here before. So it wasn't like it was totally an unknown element. They just personally didn't have much <?>input on it</?>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So you have a few weeks left, right, before going back to the States?</A>
<B>I've got about six weeks.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> yeah</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>But</OL> I'm not going back to the States.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>I'm gonna <SC>miss</SC> <SC>mic</SC> meet, little <??></??> of that,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><F>er</F></OL> my sister in Thailand <OL>and a <SC>friend of ours</SC></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> <F>hm</F></OL>. <OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>mutual friend</OL> of ours. And <F>er</F> travel around and do a <??></??> charter in Phuket which might be a bad idea given the recent warnings that have come out about that area. But we'll try to stay away from the clubs and the touristy spots. And I think we should be O K.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So it should be fun.</B>
</followup>
</stage4>
<stage5>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. <F>Well</F> we're gonna <F>um</F> wrap up here.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>.</B>
<A>And <F>um</F> is there anything else that you're definitely gonna do before you go to Thailand?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> we're going to Kyoto and Osaka on the <JP>Shinkansen</JP> this weekend. Actually we're taking an overnight bus on the way there, which</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>should be interesting if I can sleep.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Erm</F> what else? There's a really, really big electronic music concert in the Makuhari Messe</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>in the middle of December. And I'd really like to go to that if I get the chance. <F>Erm</F> it's a little expensive, works out to be about fifty-five dollars U S.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><?>Fun</?>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But it should be a really good show. So I'm <?>probably</?> going to it anyway. <F>Erm</F> what else is going on? <F>Oh</F> we're going to <F>er</F> Nikko at the end of this month around Thanksgiving. Looking forward to that. That should be cool. And <F>er</F> I'm taking a test next Friday. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL>What subject</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>That's the only</OL> thing that's on my mind. <R>It's</R> <F>er</F> it's on the "Tale of Genji" in Japanese arts and society. It's just kinda <??></??> for this</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Japanese culture. So it should be good.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <CO>Did you have to read a summary about the novel or</CO>?</A>
<B>We actually read the first thirteen chapters <OL>on it</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> you did</OL>.</A>
<B>In English.</B>
<A><F>Uh</F> <F>uh-huh</F>. <F>Well</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Definitely in English</OL>.</B>
<A>Obviously. <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> <F>erm</F> yeah.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Good luck on that.</A>
