<A><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>It looks</OL> like, you know, a little bit different from the people in <H pn="others2">XXX03</H> or <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>. <F>Urm</F> I mean <R>the</R> their fashion is</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>special</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><R>Wha</R> what do you mean?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <.></.> it is difficult to explain but <F>urm</F> their fashion is very advanced</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>and <SC>very <F>ur</F> <.></.> strong or</SC> the color is very strong.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>So yeah, it is very fun to</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>only see them.</B>
<A>Interesting.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>O K. All right, <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>, <F>urr</F> do you have any hobby?</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Urm</F> I like taking photos.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> recently, I made homepage</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>for my photos.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>So I sometime go to <.></.> <F>urm</F> a lot of <SC>place</SC> places and then take photos and upload the photos to <SC>ho</SC> my homepage.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. Good. So how did you get interested in photography?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> last summer, I went to <H pn="others5">XXX06</H>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And at <H pn="others5">XXX06</H>, I <.></.> go to the <F>urm</F> <H pn="others6">XXX07</H> which is <H pn="others6">XXX07</H>. It is a very short course for <SC>the</SC> <F>ur</F> studying taking photography. And I did that course. And then, I start <F>urr</F> taking photos very interesting.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>Before that, I've never <.></.> doing that.</B>
<A>I see. So what about taking <R>photogra</R> photograph is the most difficult thing?</A>
<B><F>Urrm</F> one is the technique because we have to <F>urm</F> <.></.> pay attention to the light. It is a little bit different from <.></.> seeing with your eyes. You know, it's a different. And so you have to <.></.> be aware of that differences.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>And we have to image <F>urm</F> how the photography <F>urm</F> developed. And then, we have to shoot.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>So that imagination is the most difficult thing, I think.</B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>I see. O K. All right. So, first thing today, please look at this picture.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>And please describe this picture.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> here is a room. And there is one woman and there is one dog and one cat. And one woman is sitting in a chair and she is pointing the computers. <F>Urm</F> the dog is, I think, sleeping on the floor and the cat is sleeping on a bed. And the door is half-opened. And in the room there's <F>urm</F> audio, and computers, <SC>desks</SC> desk and word processor, I think. <F>Uhm</F> yeah, that's all.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. O K. <F>Well</F> you mentioned you opened your own homepage.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>How did you open your homepage?</A>
<B>How open? What do you mean by how?</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F> what kind of process did you go through?</A>
<B>Process? <F>Urm</F> firstly, I have to, of course, make the contents.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>So I made contents by <nvs>cough</nvs> special application</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>which is <F>ur</F> for making homepages.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>.</A>
<B>And I made the contents.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Like, you know, it's like <F>urm</F> writing <.></.> your report by <SC>word proce</SC> <F>urr</F> Word or something like that.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>It's very near to that. And then, I have to <nvs>cough</nvs> get my address. So I call my provider. And I get my <R>pro</R> provider.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And then, I upload my contents to my address by <F>urm</F> <F>urm</F> again special <.></.> software.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. O K. All right. So I think you have your own room.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. Can you compare your room to her room?</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F> <F>urm</F> my room is <SC>very <F>urm</F> <.></.> near to <R>this</R> <.></.> this</SC> very similar to this room because I have computer <F>urm</F> in my room. But my computer is <F>urm</F> notebook.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So that's the big difference.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And I have also audio and bed. But <F>urm</F> in my room, there is no animals because now, <F>urm</F> there is no animal in my house.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>So that's second differences. <F>Urmm</F> <F>urm</F> also I have a window and clock. So it's very similar <OL>to this room</OL>.</B>

<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And</OL> this happened before, so please start your story with "One day last week".</A>
<B>O K. <F>Urm</F> this story is about <F>ur</F> in the last week. <F>Urm</F> on the road, there was <.></.> a couple walking <.></.> and it was raining that day. And suddenly, the man <.></.> heard <SC>something</SC> some voice. And <R>it was the</R> <F>urm</F> <F>huh</F> <.></.> it was the <F>urr</F> <SC>voice of</SC> voice from the cat.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>And so he look around and found the cat in the box. And then, <F>urm</F> a woman <.></.> wants to <F>uhm</F> bring back home the cat. But a man said, "No, we can't do it". But <F>urm</F> a woman really wants to <.></.> bring the cat back. So <F>urm</F> she <??></??> <F>urm</F> the boyfriend. And then, they <F>urr</F> get the <.></.> cat back to home</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>together.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. All right. So <.></.> did you have a pet before?</A>
<B>Yeah. I had two cats <.></.> <OL>in my house</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Two</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>Because <F>ur</F> my family love cats.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F> not dogs?</A>
<B><F>Urmm</F> not dogs. <OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Why is that</OL>?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> because <SC>cats is not so</SC> you know, <F>urm</F> <.></.> cats <SC>is not so <F>urm</F> royalty</SC> <.></.> don't have so much royalty to their owner.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>And I think it's very cute. And also my family thinks that.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. Can you tell me the best memory with the two cats?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yeah. <F>Uhm</F> one of my cats <.></.> is <R>very</R> <F>urm</F> <.></.> very smart. <F>Urm</F> it is she. <F>Er</F> she can open the door <OL><SC>by sh</SC></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>by herself.</B>
<A><laughter>How did she do that</laughter>?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> it's not the door like <F>urm</F> the balls of the door but it is like this one.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>So she get on the table</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>and then she jumped to the <R>han</R> <F>urm</F> handle of the door. Then she <F>urm</F> touch the handle, then she can open it.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>And so <R>we</R> <F>urm</F> <.></.> we make the key which is like this one <.></.> to the door. But she can <R>even</R> even open <SC>this one</SC> this key because she punch <.></.> from the,</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>.</A>
<B>you know, beneath. And she unlock it. And then she can open door.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. Smart cat.</A>
<B>Yeah. And so this is my most interesting memory</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhmm</F> I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><SC>of the cat</SC> of them</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. What do you think the biggest advantage of keeping a pet as your family member?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> <.></.> I think <F>urm</F> we can feel that when <.></.> we go back home alone, <.></.> because <R>if there is no family</R> <.></.> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>if there is no family in a home,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>you <.></.> would feel a little bit loneliness. But if there is <SC>a</SC> <.></.> <SC>some animal</SC> some <.></.> life <R>in the</R> in the house, you can feel a little bit warm. And you can talk with the cats. So, that is the best advantage to <SC>keep</SC> <?>holding a</?> <F>ur</F> pets.</B>
