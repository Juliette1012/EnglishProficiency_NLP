And, <F>well</F> from the second rows, <F>um</F> students <R>are</R> are having a drink and talking to a friend. So I guess this is a noisy classroom <SC?>in</SC?> and <F>um</F> it seems like most of the students are not working hard.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. Right.</A>
<B>And the teacher doesn't seems to be angry. <F>Um</F> maybe, <F>uh</F> she is used to this situation all the time. <..></..></B>

And, <F>um</F> yes, they were always very keen to study. And <F>er</F> my math teacher was <F>er</F> very kind, polite teacher. And, <SC>I</SC> yeah, I real enjoyed the math <OL>classes</OL>.</B>

<B>And <F>erm</F> <F>um</F> <R>the sho</R> the shops were very limited, and <F>well</F> the older clothes was very cheap at the <?>same</?>.

And <F>well</F> I had no time to jump into <R>rail</R> <F>um</F> railway and <R>pick</R> pick it up. So <?><F>well</F></?> I had a little argument <R>with</R> with the man who dropped <R>my</R> <F>er</F> my bag. <F>Um</F> meanwhile, <F>um</F> <R>sud</R> <F>um</F> suddenly, the train came in.

So, <F>um</F> at the end, I asked the <F>um</F> <R>train</R> train person <SC>and</SC> to pick my back safely. And he <?>resume it</?> <F>um</F> to me <?>safely</?>.</B>

And <F>er</F> he seems to be happy, and, you know, <F>um</F> <R>he</R> <F>er</F> he had a lot of gestures. So <F>um</F> he didn't mean to <F>um</F> drop the man's bag, but it was an accident.</B>
