<B><F>Ah</F> yes, yes. <F>Er</F> <SC>he</SC> you know <R>he</R> he takes <F>er</F> train <SC>to go</SC> everyday to go to his school. And maybe <SC>he ca</SC> he caught a cold on the train. <F>Em</F> because <F>eh</F> you know, <SC>the flu is <F>eh</F> very</SC> <F>mm</F> <SC>people</SC> many people have flu nowadays. And yesterday, <SC>he's</SC> he said <R>he</R> he felt a little <F>mm</F> strange. And <R>I</R> I made him <F>eh</F> go to bed early last night.
