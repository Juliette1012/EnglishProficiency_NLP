</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. All right. But, why did you call him your host father?</A>

<A><F>Ahh</F>.</A>
<B>And <R>I</R> <F>urr</F> I used to live <F>urr</F> with my host family.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F> <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> <R>four</R> four months ago, I went to <R>the</R> the United State and I have a great time with my host family. And <SC>it is so</SC> it was so impress for me.

<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>It's good memory</SC> <R>it's</R> it's good memory.</B>
<A>O K. Then, is this picture different from <F>urr</F> your neighbourhood in America?</A>
<B>I think there is two difference <R>between</R> <F>urr</F> between them. One is size, the other is a cost. I think.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> <F>umm</F> usually, <SC>the United</SC> the house in United States has four <R>ba</R> <SC>bath</SC> <SC>bedrooms</SC> four bathrooms and big living. <F>Urr</F> in my house, <SC>I just</SC> <R>I have</R> I have one living room and one bedroom. That's all. And <R>the other</R> the other difference is as for the cost. Probably it cost about <F>umm</F> <F>um</F> <F>umm</F> <R>four million dollar</R> four million dollar to get the my house.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>Yes. <CO>But</CO>.</B>
<A>I'm sorry, I made <OL>a wrong</OL> question.</A>
<B><OL>Sorry</OL>?</B>
<A>Is this picture</A>
<B><F>Uh-hum</F>.</B>
<A>different from your host family's neighborhood in America?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> <F>em</F> so <F>erm</F> <SC>I think</SC> <F>umm</F> sorry <F>urr</F> I think <F>urr</F> one difference. <SC>It's a</SC> <F>urr</F> my host father has a children. But my neighbor doesn't have the any children. So it's a big difference. And also, <F>ur</F> house style is little difference. <F>Urr</F> my <SC>fa</SC> host father's house has one floor, but <SC>my neigh</SC> my host family's neighbor has the two floor, you know. I think it's a difference.</B>
