<B>But <F>er</F> when I <.></.> <R>came back</R> <F>uh</F> came back home and I tried, <F>er</F> the sound <R>was</R> was not really good. <R>So</R> <.></.> so maybe <R>par</R> partly, <R>it i</R> it is my fault. But it also your fault <F>er</F> that you recommended this tape recorder to me. Because I really wanted to buy a good tape recorder.</B>
<A><.></.> But this one does sound good.</A>
