And, <F>erm</F> as you know, <F>er</F> <SC>in the</SC> <F>er</F> <R>in</R> in this season is the end of the accounting term. And <F>erm</F> <R>I</R> <F>er</F> I have to <F>ur</F> make a lot of documents for my bosses. <SC>And <F>erm</F> I</SC> and I'm a accountant. <F>Erm</F>. So I'm very busy.</B>
<A>So, what do you do when you feel very very sleepy? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><laughter><F>Mmm</F></laughter>. If I feel very sleepy, <nvs>laughter</nvs> I rush to the <R>toi</R> toilet, <laughter><R>and</R></laughter> and <F>erm</F> <SC>I'm</SC> <F>erm</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I sleep <F>er</F> with using the <F>er</F> <SC>roll</SC> <F>er</F> tissue roll, <R>and</R> <SC>and</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <SC>back of</SC> <SC>back</SC> <F>ur</F> on the back of my neck, and <F>erm</F> <SC><R>it</R> it was</SC> it is very comfortable. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>

<B><F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Erm</F>. Why have you decided to be an accountant?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. I've not decided <R>to</R> to be an accountant. <F>Erm</F>. Because the company <F>er</F> <R>decide</R> <F>er</F> decide me to <F>erm</F> be an accountant. <F>Umm</F>. And I'd like to be a sales person. <F>Umm</F>. <R>And</R> <F>erm</F> and now, <R>I</R> I have the same dream <F>erm</F> to be a sales person. So <F>umm</F> sometimes <F>er</F> I said such things <F>er</F> to my bosses. And <F>erm</F> <SC>I try</SC> I would try to change my job to a sales person.</B>
<A><F>Umm</F>. Is it possible?</A>
<B>Yeah, I think so. <F>Erm</F>. But, <F>erm</F> <R>ma</R> <R>maybe</R> maybe, <F>erm</F> in six months, <F>erm</F> <SC>I will try</SC> I will change to the sales person.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> that's great. So, why do you want to be a sales person?</A>
