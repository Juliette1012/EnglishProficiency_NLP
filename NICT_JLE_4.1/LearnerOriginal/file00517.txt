That means most of them <F>er</F> will <SC>go</SC> <F>er</F> ready to go to university. So, now, everyday, <R>I had a</R> I had a <R>inter</R> <F>er</F> interview with my students <F>er</F> which university they should go. I have to advise them.</B>

<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>

<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><.></.> <F>Err</F> <SC>last</SC> <.></.> yesterday, I came back to <F>er</F> Japan from Germany. <F>Er</F> <R>I</R> <.></.> I joined a pack tour to Germany in your company. <F>Um</F> and, <F>um</F> <SC>according to the <SC>pam</SC> brochure, <F>err</F> we have a</SC> according to the brochure, <SC>we are going</SC> <R>we can go</R> we can go to a <F>erm</F> <.></.> castle.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F>. <?>Norahide</?> Castle. <R>And</R> and they said <SC>we can <F>er</F> go</SC> we can enter the castle. So <SC>I'm very</SC> I was very expecting <F>er</F> because I could <F>er</F> enter the castle. But, <F>er</F> when I went there, <F>er</F> <SC>it wa</SC> the castle was closed.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>uh</F> we couldn't enter it. So I think <SC>the</SC> <.></.> your explanation <SC>was different from the</SC> <.></.> <R>was</R> was very different.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F>.</B>

<A>O K.</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F>.</B>
<A>I think <F>err</F> <.></.> we have to do something <SC>for the <F>er</F> tre</SC> as a treatment, but <F>um</F> <F>well</F> it's not our fault, in fact. Because the castle was closed. We can't do anything for that.</A>
<B>Yeah. But <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> pamphlet said <SC>we can go</SC> we can <R>enter th</R> enter the castle. <SC>So that means</SC> <F>err</F> <.></.> <SC>but <F>uhm</F> you have</SC> <R>I wou</R> <laughter>I would</laughter> like you <R>to</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> to do something for us.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. Then I understand that. So, maybe, <F>um</F> next tour, we can <F>um</F> <SC>have</SC> give some discount.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> but, <F>err</F> now, <nvs>cough</nvs> I'm not planning to go to another trip in a few years. So <F>er</F> I don't like it.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
