<B>English education.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>. So what's the most interesting thing for your study?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I'm interested in a testing. Right now I'm studying <F>uh</F> statistic things. It's like <F>uh</F> mathematics. <SC>So</SC> I'm not good at mathematics so it's kind of difficult for me.</B>
<A>Yeah?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A>Have you taught to adults, too?</A>
<B>Adult? Sometimes I do. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>? So what's the difference between teaching for children and teaching for adults?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>hum</F> <R>adult</R> <F>uum</F> <F>well</F> <F>uum</F> <SC>adult</SC> most adult has a background. They studied <SC>cou</SC> certain minimum things already. But children, they know nothing. Pure white. So they see alphabet, but they can say <SC>the</SC> maybe A or B, but they don't know what does the actually letter work <SC>in esp</SC> <SC>ex</SC> for example, in a reading, you know. <F>Mm</F>. I think it's like <F>ah</F> Arabian letters to me. It's just a picture. <R>To</R> <R>to</R> to children, English letter is just a picture. So but it's interesting. I like <OL>teaching them</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah, then</OL>, now how do you teach to children effectively?</A>
<B><F>Uhh</F>. Use phonics. <F>Hum</F>.</B>
<A>What's that?</A>
<B>Phonics?</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Uhh</F>. Phonics. <F>Uh</F>. I heard that's the way that American children learn or native English speaking children learn how to read. Basically <SC>I guess it's a</SC> no, no, I think <F>uh</F> letter shows the sound. And <R>they</R> they have to kind of learn this letter has certain sound kind of.</B>

<B><F>Well</F> it's so fun because you know, everybody like it. Even a baby or old people or men, men like it because we show the lots of skin. <?>The</?> men like it and young children sometimes <SC>like</SC> for example, like social dance, children can't enjoy it.

<ctxt>The interviewee is thinking for a while.</ctxt>
<B>O K. <F>Ur</F>. One day last week, <SC>we were</SC> <R>we are going to</R> we are going to camping. And we packed many things for camping like <F>uh</F> light or things to cook meal or tent. And we put those in <F>uh</F> our van, and <SC>left</SC> <F>uh</F> went to <F>uh</F> the river. And we made the tent, and we started cooking. Then suddenly, <R>it</R> it started raining. And then eventually, <SC>it gets</SC> it got so bad, I mean like a <R>rea</R> real storm. Stormy weather. So we <?>brought</?> our things, and quickly got on a van, and looked for <F>ur</F> some place to stay overnight. And we found <F>uh</F> hotel. And then <SC>in a</SC> we got in a hotel. And then we had a cup of coffee, and relax. And actually it was good hotel, and had a nice view so we enjoyed that.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. O K. Thank you very much.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So do you do some outdoor activities like camping?</A>
<B>Outdoor. <F>Um</F>. I used to do, but not recently.</B>
<A>Yeah? Why not recently?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. I got busier, and <SC>get</SC> don't have enough time recently.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Hum</F>. But <F>uh</F> <F>urm</F> it seems many Japanese especially young people enjoy outdoor activities these days. So why do you think it's happening?</A>
<B><F>Hum</F>. It's fun. I used to go when I was a student <SC>had a</SC> when <SC>I had a time</SC> I had a plenty time, you know. Fishing and just cooking with friends. It's fun. So people usually wants to share time together outside. And they feel more open so they can talk more. <SC?>Kind</SC?> they feel more <SC>friendly</SC> friendliness, I guess.</B>
<A>So what are the differences, relaxing in nature outdoor and relaxing <SC>in a</SC></A>
<B><OL>Indoor</OL>?</B>
<A><OL>inside</OL> of the house? Yeah.</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. If you wanna spend time inside, I mean with friends, <SC>you have to</SC> <F>uh</F> talking is key. You have to talk. But outside, you don't have to keep talking. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And just staying there together and doing something little bit there and here, and people can enjoy. But inside you know, unless you do some board game or watch movie, or you have to talk with friends. And sometimes it's too stressful, maybe.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Hum</F>. O K. Yeah. Thank you.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
