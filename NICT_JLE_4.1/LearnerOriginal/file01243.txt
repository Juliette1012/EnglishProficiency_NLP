<A>Sure.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> my mom was driving. And <F>ur</F> she usually <SC>took</SC> doesn't take that road. It was <F>ur</F> like a dangerous street. But it was a short-cut to our house.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And she was in a hurry.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>So she had no choice so she took that road. I think it was near Santa Monica. I forgot. But anyway, we <F>ur</F> stopped at a traffic light. And <F>ur</F> two men were walking in front of us.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>And among all these other people.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>

<A><OL><F>Ahh</F></OL>.</A>
<B>And I noticed that at that moment, and I freaked and I just was quiet. I couldn't do anything. And my mom didn't know. She was like you know, looking around, waiting for the light to change. And I was like, "<F>Ahhh</F>.". And then <R>the</R> the man next to him, <R>he</R> he went like that. <nvs>clap</nvs></B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>And said, "Stop it.".</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>And then they just walked on. And that's how we were saved and survived. <nvs>laughter</nvs> But that was a scary experience.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> sure.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ahh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Because</OL> it was in L A. And <OL>yeah</OL>.</B>

<A><F>Mm</F>. And you said it's kind of difficult,</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>you know, to find things here.</A>
<B><OL><??></??></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>So</OL> how do you <SC>go about</SC></A>

<B><OL>at home</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> and I'm organic, too.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>So I order organic foods and I'd rather not eat food outside because I know <R>it's</R> it's poisoned, <laughter>as</laughter> I would put it.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> genetically modified products are out there. <F>Ur</F> I don't trust it very much. So I order everything, and I would <SC>ra</SC> much rather have my kids eat the same as I do.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>ur</F> I enjoy cooking at home <F>ur</F> under the very busy <laughter>circumstances</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>I try</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>as hard as I can. <F>Urm</F> <F>ur</F> what was your question, sorry?</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> just how do you manage.</A>

<A><OL><F>Mm</F></OL> <F>mm</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> Or <F>ur</F> "Please omit the <??></??> or whatever <?>is</?> inside.".</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>That's how I do it.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>But then <F>er</F> I eat a little bit of fish and the fish broth is always in Japanese food.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>Almost always.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>urm</F> my foreign friends who are strictly vegetarians, they call vegans, <F>ur</F> they have a very hard time when they come to Japan.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F></B>

<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I didn't like eggs at all</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>when I was growing up.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>But mom would serve it, and I would reluctantly eat it. But then like maybe ten, eleven, twelve years ago, I thought <F>ur</F> <F>well</F> people who love to eat meat or eggs, <F>eh</F> <F>eh</F> that's fine.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>I mean I don't have anything against <OL>them</OL>.</B>
