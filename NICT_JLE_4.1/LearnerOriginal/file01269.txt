<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> one thing is about the school.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Right</OL>. So yeah. I like the school.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>. <SC>It's</SC> I know it's very, very liberal school. And then I'm studying about Japan.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So in terms of Japan studies, <SC>one of the</SC> one of best school. And then also I'm studying about <F>er</F> medical and policy. I don't know if you're familiar with this. <F>Er</F> but the theme is the medicine. Right. But at the same time, <F>um</F> <SC>study per se</SC> study itself is <F>ur</F> <F>er</F> anthropology.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So yeah, studying about social medicine <SC>within <R>the</R> the regime of anthropology</SC> yeah, in the field of anthropology. So yeah, that's a sort of unique subjects. Yeah. So that's the oldest school in the world,</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>this sort of study.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> <F>ah</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So yeah</OL>. <F>Er</F> so that's why I chose to <OL>live there, yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>So now you came back to <laughter>Japan</laughter>,</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>I guess your life now is quite different from the life in <OL><H pn="others5">XXX07</H></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah, of course</OL>.</B>
<A>So what's the <SC>most d</SC> biggest difference between lives?</A>
<B>One is space. Right.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>And so living space.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <R>it's</R> <F>er</F> it's very wide, open space <OL><?>I think</?></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>in the States. Especially in the <H pn="others7">XXX09</H>. Right. So but at the same time <SC>if you go t</SC> because of that, right, <SC>so if you</SC> wherever you go, you have to use <F>er</F> automobile.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. Or yeah. Or <SC?>mo</SC?> at least you need a bike or something. All right. <F>Um</F> but here, wherever you go, you have to use commuter trains. Right? So that's a huge differences. Of course you know, <R>there</R> <R>there</R> there are some commute trains <R>in</R> in that area. <SC>However</SC> yeah, so here, you know the train system and bus system are really complicated.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>So <?>you get</?> used to it. And <R>then</R> then <SC>also this is</SC> you know for me, this is the first time to live in <F>er</F> <H pn="others8">XXX10</H>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I have to know everything.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Almost everything</OL>.</B>
<A><laughter>O K, everything, O K</laughter>.</A>
<B><OL><SC>But</SC> so yeah, so that's why, you know</OL> if you ask me you know, <SC>what</SC> you know what's going on in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, it's so hard to say, "<F>Oh</F> <OL><F><?>well</?></F>."</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>I have to think about it</OL>.</B>

<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Umm</F> <F>um</F> <SC>it's a</SC> probably it's a long story. <F>Er</F> the my first encounter of <JP>wadaiko</JP> was in Sado. You know in Sado Island?</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A>That's <R>the</R> the place where the professional group called Kodo <F>oh</F> they establish group, yeah, in order to invite people to the countryside</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>rather than</OL>, you know, <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> seeing, you know, local people away from <OL>the countryside</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><R>So</R> so then they establish <?>it</?>. And then they decide to invite, you know, all the musicians and people from all over the world.</A>
<B><F>Wow</F>.</B>
<A>And they have a festival during the summertime.</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>.</B>
<A>The <R>end of</R> end of <R>Au</R> August. So for week-long festival and they also invite <F>um</F> different kind of percussionists from all over the world.</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>.</B>
<A>And then they collaborate. <OL>And</OL></A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>yeah, so everybody like the jam together. <F>Um</F> and every single day, <SC?>they sh</SC?> <F>er</F> they hold concert. So then that was my first encounter. I said "<F>Wow</F>. This is cool.".

<B>But since then, <F>er</F> my view on <JP>wadaiko</JP> has totally changed. <F>Uh-uh</F>. This is a musical instrument. And they're so serious. And then this Kodo, you know, <R>this</R> this group, you know about the Kodo, they travel all the world to play <SC>abo</SC> for about hundred days a year. <R>They</R> <R>they</R> they play outside of Japan.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And the other hundred days, <F>er</F> stay in <F>er</F> Japan and then playing over Japan.</B>

So then I can see them as <F>well</F> as the local people. I can <R>see</R> see in <H pn="others10">XXX12</H>. And then the guy called <H pn="others11">XXX13</H> who brought the <JP>taiko</JP> <F>er</F> from <H pn="others8">XXX10</H>, <F>er</F> he also establish his own group <F>oh</F> there for the <H pn="others10">XXX12</H> <JP>taiko dojo</JP>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>

<B>The wedding, you know, ceremony. That was really amazing. <F>Er</F> <OL>so</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.</A>
<B>yeah we were so connected.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> O K. Then <F>um</F> when you see <F>er</F> the way of spending their</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>er</F> free time, could you compare the style of American people to Japanese one? How to spend their spare time or</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>.</B>
<A><?>use your</?> time. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Free time</OL> activities? <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> yeah in a way, like the <H pn="others14">XXX16</H> is one of the area <F>er</F> <F>um</F> people who are living there, they are very spoiled.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really?</A>
<B>Yeah, because you can do anything. Like arts are there. Right. So if you really like arts, any kind of arts including painting and music or performing arts, so you know, if you wait for two years, so within two years, one famous musicians, <R>the</R> they all come in to <H pn="others14">XXX16</H>. You only need to wait <R>one or two years</R> one or <R>two</R> two years. So you can't imagine that kind of place in the world. Maybe Tokyo.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But Tokyo is little bit too crowded. Right. So it's so hard to get a ticket. But <H pn="others14">XXX16</H>, it's not that crowded. So most likely, you can get tickets to see this, you know, other performers. So that's one thing. Right? <F>Erm</F> also in terms of the sports, also if you want surf, you can surf, although <SC>it's real cold</SC> the water is really cold. But wave is so good. Right? And also there's mountain, <F>er</F> <R>the</R> the place called <H pn="others15">XXX17</H> the <H pn="others15">XXX17</H>. If you go there, you can do any sort of, you know, <F>er</F> sports which means like you can go to skiing, <F>er</F> snowboarding, <F>er</F> you name it. So then there are bunch of hot springs along the <H pn="others16">XXX18</H>, the mountain.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> <?>already</?> you know, <SC>you</SC> there's a <R>casi</R> casino <R>in</R> in <H pn="others17">XXX19</H>. And if you go to <H pn="others18">XXX20</H>, and <H pn="others19">XXX21</H> county, so there are vineyards. So you can enjoy bunch of different kinds of wines. You know the <H pn="others20">XXX22</H> is the best in the world. <nvs>snap</nvs> <OL><nvs>snap</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Wow</F></OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Yeah. Seriously, yeah. Yeah. <F>Er</F> because the soil and the weather.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Er</F> the French wine, it's famous because of their marketing, you know. Right. But in terms of quality, the <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> is best. We are so spoiled. Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>So even the supermarket, we can get wine, but it's really, really good wine. Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So yeah. <F>Uh</F> <F>uh</F> so <SC>y</SC> <SC>after you live in</SC> <F>uh</F> you know, after you live in <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> <F>er</F> I don't know, <F>er</F> how much you can enjoy wine in Japan. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><CO><R>Ye</R> yeah so</CO>. And then in terms of foods, <F>er</F> as you know, there are bunch of different community in <H pn="others14">XXX16</H>. If you go to, say even in <H pn="others10">XXX12</H> you can go to <H pn="others19">XXX21</H>, <F>er</F> there is an Italian community. <?>All right</?>, so also like in China Town, also Japan town, you know, <F>er</F> some other Latino people doing some other sort of things. So each area, <R>you can</R> you can enjoy different kind of food.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So which</OL> means <SC>e</SC> living there means you can enjoy the world from all the world.</B>
