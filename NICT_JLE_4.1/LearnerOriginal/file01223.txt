<B><F>Um</F> I have a mother and a father and I have two brothers.</B>
<A><SC>What does your bro</SC> <F>er</F> what does your father do?</A>
<B>My father works for a bank. <.></.></B>
<A>What kind of person he is.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> he is a decent person.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>He is kind to my mom and my family. And he <R>c</R> <F>um</F> cares about us a lot. And he likes to play with our cat.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>I see. Good. Now, <F>er</F> so <SC>what</SC> how do you usually spend your free time?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I go shopping or I go <F>um</F> just ride my <SC>bike</SC> bicycle around my house. And sometimes I jog.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Um</F> Tell me about your hobby.</A>
<B>My hobby? Yes. I like to read books. <F>Um</F> books about Japan and <F>um</F> the relation between Japan and other countries. I used to read Sherlock Holmes a <laughter>lot</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Why do you like him?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> because, you know, the stories are full of adventure.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>And at the end of the book, you get to know what really happened.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And you get to know how he, you know, found out who caused the incident or murder or whatever.</B>
<A>I see. I see.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Good. Good. And you like to read a book about Japan?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>Do you like to live in Japan?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><R>What kind of</R> what kind of things do you feel fascinated about Japanese culture?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> you know, many foreign people who come to Japan say things like Japanese don't have the ability to communicate with other people, like they're not so friendly, and they sometimes criticize it in a not a nice way.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> <R>I</R> I thought that maybe it's just their culture. I mean, Japan used to be a country like <F>um</F> <SC>not <R>so</R> <SC>social</SC> so</SC> it didn't really socialize with the other <OL>countries</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>So maybe people aren't just used to it <R>and</R> <F>um</F> and the foreigners who come to Japan <SC>are</SC> of course, <SC>they <?>into the</?> <SC?>u</SC?> <?>not</?> <?>you l</?> <?>u</?></SC> they like to socialize a lot. So I think that <SC>it's just kind of a</SC> what do you say, it's just their opinions</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>of seeing <R>how</R> how Japanese are. And <R>I thin</R> I think that's kind of a prejudice.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>I see.</A>

And some of them are studying and they're listening to what the teacher is saying. But <F>er</F> more than half of them are doing their own stuff.

<task>
<A>Lastly today, I would like to show you <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>um</F> sequence of pictures. Let's see. Yeah, let's do this one. <F>Er</F> speaking of train, let's try this. Now, this time, <SC?>I would like to</SC?> <?><F>uh</F> wha</?> I would like you to make up a short story</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>based on</OL> these pictures from number one to six. This happened before.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>So please start your story with "One day last week". O K? Go ahead.</A>
<B>One day last week, <F>er</F> Mister Jacobs was walking towards <SC>the train</SC> I mean the station. And then <SC>he</SC> <F>er</F> when he reached the platform, he accidentally dropped his suitcase. <SC>And</SC> <F>oh</F> but it wasn't an accident. It was actually <F>er</F> a person beside him <F>er</F> <laughter><?>tucked</?> him</laughter> by his elbow and he dropped it. So he explained to the person beside him that it was his fault that he dropped his suitcase. But while they were arguing, the train had arrived and the train nearly <F>er</F> <SC?>wen</SC?> passed through the suitcase. <SC>So he</SC> so Mister Jacobs was really <F>er</F> upset because he thought that his suitcase was <F>er</F> ruined. But after the train passed, he found that the suitcase was O K and he was relieved. And later on, <R>the</R> <F>er</F> <SC>the station</SC> a man who works for the station <F>er</F> <.></.> got the suitcase for him. And he pass it to <OL>him</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. Good. Thank you very much. Can I have the card back?</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Now, there are lots of people who has a very rude behavior in the platform or on the train. What do you think <R>of</R> of people, <F>er</F> <SC?>for spe</SC?> <F>er</F> for instance, young lady who puts makeup on on the train?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. <F>Oh</F> sometimes I see those people on the train and <SC>I</SC> at first when I saw it for the first time, I thought it was kind of embarrassing as <F>um</F> a woman,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>cause, you know, makeup is something that you do to <F>er</F> not show <laughter>your real face</laughter> or something, to cover <laughter>up your real face</laughter>. <laughter><CO>So</CO></laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. But as I got used to it, <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I started to feel nothing and <SC>I thi</SC> <R>I</R> I thought that maybe they didn't have time to do it in their homes or something.</B>
<A>I see. What about talking loudly on the cell phone?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <R>I</R> I don't <?>improve with</?> that, because <SC>it can</SC> you know, <F>um</F> it would disturb other passengers on the train and maybe people get annoyed just to hear other people talk. So I don't think that's a good thing.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. I see. O K. Good. <?>So</?> thank you. Now, <F>um</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> <JP>san</JP>, <R>you</R> you stayed in <F>er</F> foreign countries more than a year?</A>
