<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>Yes. <SC>That is ne</SC> now, that is basical meaning of <JP>Kakaadenka</JP>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see.</A>
<B><JP>Hai</JP>.</B>
<A>So, original meaning was different.</A>
<B>Yes, unfortunately. But, I think very few people only know the original meaning, <OL>I think</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL>. Why did the meaning change?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. I think you can imagine <JP>Kakaadenka</JP> mean, <SC>the wife</SC> how can I say, <SC>wives</SC> wife is king or queen, you know. <.></.> We cannot imagine the <.></.> original meaning from the word. So, I'm not sure why the meaning was change, but unfortunately. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. O K.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>So, what do you usually do on your free time?</A>
<B>Free time. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So, on the weekend, <.></.> <SC>I'm</SC> usually I do cooking, of course, laundry or clean up my rooms, and another free time, I'm watching movies, or videos, of course, studying English.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> good. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>So, do you like cooking?</A>

<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL> <R>wha</R> what do you cook?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> anything I can, maybe. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Really.</A>
<B>But, unfortunately, you know, my room is, how can I say, very small, one room type apartment. So, cooking is very small <JP><F>ne</F></JP>. Therefore, <SC>me</SC> usually I cook <F>er</F> some stew or such as <R>very</R> <JP>nanteiuno</JP> very easy <.></.> <SC>cook</SC> dishes. And also, I have <.></.> some <.></.> special dishes. <JP>nante iunokana</JP> The trade name is Shuttle Chef. Shuttle Chef is <SC>the</SC> <R>some kind</R> <F>er</F> some kind of <R>cooking</R> <.></.> cooking tool.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. What is good <OL>about that</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Ah</F></OL> <SC>I</SC> very difficult to explain. So, for instance, you know some <SC>pots ja</SC> pot jar <SC>to keep warm</SC> to keep hot some <SC>waters</SC> hot waters. So, the Shuttle Chef is the system's like that. So, to keep stew or something dishes <SC>to warm</SC> to keep warm.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>So, according <R>the</R> the system or, how can I say, such as tool, <F>um</F> we can cook some stew <SC>without the</SC> <.></.> <SC>how</SC> <F>er</F> <R>without the</R> <.></.> without the gas <JP>konro</JP> or electric.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>Can you imagine that? <R>If</R> <F>er</F> if we stew <SC>on a</SC> on the pot jar, <.></.> the stew still keep hot, very hot.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see.</A>
<B>So, the ingredient of stew become soft or become <.></.> <nvs>laughter</nvs>.</B>
<A>Doesn't it take a lot of time?</A>
<B><SC>What a</SC> <.></.> not time mean? <F>Ah</F>. Depends on the <F>ah</F> dishes. But, without the gas or without fire is very safe for us.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>And when we put on a stew on the <R>fi</R> fire, <SC>the</SC> when usually we <.></.> take miss <JP><F>ne</F></JP>. <.></.> <R>To</R> to cook <R>very ha</R> very hard or very bad. So, that is good for me.</B>
