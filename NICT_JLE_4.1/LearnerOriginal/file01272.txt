<A>O K. Good afternoon.</A>
<B>Hello.</B>
<A>My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have your name?</A>
<B>My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Sure. Go ahead.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Er</F> <R>why do</R> why do people call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>er</F> I lived in Canada for <R>fif</R> fifteen years. And while I was there, people couldn't pronounce my proper Japanese name, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Then they started to call me like <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> and <F>ur</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>So ended up in this name, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>And it's a shortened <F>eh</F> <F>uh</F> <R?>as</R?> as <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>I <OL>see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>And why were you in Canada?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> originally I wanted to study English there.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And I went there as a student.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And I ended up marrying with a Canadian person. And <F>er</F> I just stayed there as a result.</B>
<A>I see. And what brought you back to Japan?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>um</F> I think I needed a change of scenery.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <SC>my</SC> I was having trouble with <F>er</F> my boyfriend <OL>then</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>So <F>er</F> I had to come home and <F>er</F> look <?>for</?> something different.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Did you consider any other countries?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> no. Just home. Because <F>er</F> my father <SC>passed a</SC> had passed away a few years back prior my returning.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I thought I should be good to my mother.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Er</F></OL> <?>in order</?> to visit her and <SC>clo</SC> <F>uh</F> live closer to her.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> so long as I live in Japan,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I could visit</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>er</F> as in terms of <?>our relations</?>.</B>
<A>I <OL>see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> I didn't consider any other country.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. So do you still visit your mother?</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>. No as often <R>as</R> <F>uh</F> as I should. Because <F>uh</F> she is in hospital <F>er</F> right now. So actually <F>er</F> she's bedridden. <F>Hmm</F>. So I should be visiting her <F>mm</F> more times but <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I simply can't because <F>er</F> just my husband and I started a new business.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So it's not a good reason to say "I don't have enough time.".</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>er</F> the reality is that.</B>
<A>O K. I see.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>And who is taking care of her now?</A>
<B>My <F>er</F> elder sister and her husband.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>They are very kind. And they live close to the hospital. So they are taking care of my mother.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see. Can you tell me a little bit about your elder sister?</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>. O K. <F>Er</F> she's four years older than I am, I think. And she's been a housewife all the time. She was, at one time, <F>er</F> <SC>tea</SC> like a teacher, but after she got married, she just stayed home,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>took care of her sons and</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>husband</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So, a typical Japanese housewife.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A><F>Um</F> O K. O K. <nvs>cough</nvs> First thing today,</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>um</F> O K, I let you to describe this picture.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Hmm</F>. This is a classroom in high school, maybe. And <F>er</F> I think this lady is <SC?>t</SC?> giving a lesson in mathematics. But the <F>er</F> students' attitudes are various. Yes. Only one, <R>I thin</R> I think I see in the front row, this boy in the middle, yeah he's listening to what she's saying. But other students are doing their own things like <F>er</F> one boy, chewing gum, looking outside, and girls are talking with the boys. One boy is listening to <SC>the</SC> this <F>er</F> music while drinking some tea. And this girl is <F>er</F> sending <F>er</F> E-mail, I think. So it's not a very <F>er</F> good class.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. <F>Um</F> you said you went to Canada to study.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>Why do you think it was important to <F>um</F> study English at that time?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I didn't think <F>er</F> of English. When I wanted to go to Canada, I wanted to see abroad.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Something different from Japan.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I didn't really think of "O K, I'm going to study," but I wanted to see the different culture. And I had friends there. So <F>er</F> I got into <??></??> to visit some friends there. <F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>I see. O K.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <F>er</F> can you compare this picture to your classroom in high school days?</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. It's so long ago</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>so <F>er</F> it's hard to remember. But <F>er</F> I guess in my high school days, <F>er</F> <F>er</F> we <F>oh</F> all wore uniforms.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> <SC>I guess we ha</SC> <SC>I</SC> at least I paid respect to <SC>what I'm lis</SC> <F>uh</F> what I was taught. And then I tried to listen to all the teachers.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>You know. So the attitude was quite different. Yeah.</B>
<A>Where do you think that difference comes from?</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>. I'm not sure. But the <F>er</F> it's <F>er</F> <.></.> too much influence from <F>er</F> Western countries? I don't know maybe <F>ur</F> people <F>er</F> stress on freedom <?>or</?> other things.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>For example, uniforms. <SC>I</SC> <SC>they <R>s</R> start to say</SC> they started to say, "O K, we are individual persons so we should be able to decide what to wear to school.". So some schools, they don't have uniforms</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>these days</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>But</OL> at that time, <SC>so many years ago</SC> <F>well</F> forty years ago,</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>er</F> we didn't have that much freedom or influence. So maybe that's the difference. And <SC?>its</SC?> <F>eh</F> system is changing.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Hm</F>. O K. Thank you, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
</followup>
</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. I want to try a <F>um</F> role-play. <nvs>cough</nvs></A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is taking out a card.</ctxt>
<A>O K. Please read this card.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And</OL> tell me when you are ready to begin.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>Excuse me.</B>
<A>Yes. May I help <OL>you</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>. Yes. I don't know who to ask. But <F>er</F> I missed the train I made a reservation for.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> <F>er</F> is it possible for you to give me authorization to give me refund or change to other trains?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> we don't do refunds or exchange trains.</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>. But <F>er</F> see, <F>er</F> <SC>when I</SC> <R>wh</R> when I was about to leave the house, I had <F>er</F> an important phone call from overseas</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and I had to talk with this manager in <F>er</F> oversea countries. So <F>er</F> it took <SC>a long time</SC> longer than I had expected. So <F>er</F> I couldn't plan this one. So if it's possible, I wouldn't mind waiting here <F>um</F> for another train maybe <F>ur</F> one hour or one and a half hour.</B>
<A>But isn't it your personal reason</A>
<B><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>that you</OL> missed the train?</A>
<B>Yeah. But like I said, like I work for a company and <R>we</R> we have a various <F>er</F> branch offices <SC>national</SC> <F>er</F> worldwide.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><CO>And <SC>when I think of the</SC> when you think of the time differences, sometimes we get phone calls <SC>in a</SC> in awkward hours like early in the morning or</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So I couldn't plan. <?>There are</?> something emergency.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Something</OL> <SC>im</SC> <F>er</F> <F>uh</F> really important thing is happening in <F>er</F> <F>oh</F> branch offices,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and <F>er</F> couldn't just cut off. Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> O K. But it has to be a stand-by basis, is that all right?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>.</B>
<A>We can't make any reservations.</A>
<B>O K. I wouldn't mind at all. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B>Thank you for your help.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you so much.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>That's the end of the role-play.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Um</F> you said you have just established a company.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> what kind of company is that?</A>
<B>It's a language school. And <F>er</F> we are <F>er</F> providing services to companies in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. And <F>oh</F> <F>er</F> <SC>we</SC> since we have a basic contract with <H pn="company name1">XXX04</H>, we can send <F>er</F> teachers to teach English to their branch offices.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>um</F> that's what we are trying to do.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> what do you think is the most important point when managing <R>a</R> a company?</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. The most important point is, I think, <F>er</F> our approach. Like there are hundreds of language schools nationwide. And if we establish a company like similar to them like Nova or GEOS, we don't have any feature, special characteristics. So I guess you have to focus on <F>er</F> something unique, <SC>not</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> that is not be learned at <SC>different schools</SC> other schools, I mean.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I see. What do you consider a unique approach?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> we try to <F>er</F> use the <F>er</F> proficiency program</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>er</F> <SC>by</SC> <SC>which is, <F>er</F> I guess, a program</SC> it's a program by <H pn="company name2">XXX05</H> system, I think. And <F>er</F> of course <SC>I can't</SC> we can't <SC>do the exact program</SC> deliver the <F>er</F> exact courses. But <F>er</F> eliciting some <F>er</F> <.></.> speeches or conversations or ideas from students, <F>er</F> I think those are <SC>more i</SC> very important <OL>matters</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. <OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>I see. <OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>

<task>
<A><F>Um</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> last thing today, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, I <SC>want to</SC> <nvs>cough</nvs> want you to make up a story.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A>From number one to six. O K?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>Please begin your story with "One day last week".</A>
<B>O K. <F>Um</F> one day last week, I was <F>er</F> going to church on Sunday. And <F>um</F> I was enjoying the <F>er</F> drive. And it's only <SC>fi</SC> five minutes from home. But all of a sudden, I saw <SC>a green motorcyclist</SC> a green motorbike. And <F>er</F> this guy was talking <R>on</R> on the cellphone. Maybe <SC>she was</SC> he was talking to her <F>er</F> girlfriend. And <F>er</F> unexpectedly <F>ur</F> he <F>er</F> dropped his cellphone and <F>er</F> <SC>we bumped each other</SC> we collided <SC>each</SC> to each other. And <F>er</F> unfortunately his <R>tail</R> tail lamp was broken from the accident. And <F>er</F> <SC>he spea</SC> he claimed <SC>this is my fault</SC> "This is your fault.". But <F>er</F> <F>er</F> I couldn't agree with his <F>er</F> claim, so we called a <R>poli</R> police officer. <SC>There he ca</SC> <F>uh</F> one police officer and took a statement. <F>Er</F> I and <F>er</F> the <F>ur</F> motorcyclist, <SC>we both <F>er</F> claimed <F>er</F> what happened</SC> we explain what happened. And <F>um</F> <.></.> unfortunately, <F>er</F> his motorbike was <F>er</F> damaged too bad, so he couldn't <F>er</F> <SC>d</SC> <F>uh</F> ride on it any further. So <F>er</F> it had to be taken to the mechanics.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>

<followup>
<A><F>Um</F> how's the driving manner in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B><F>Ahh</F> I think <SC>they are <?>not</?></SC> <F>er</F> in general they are very kind.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>O K. And <R>they</R> <SC>they s</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>when it snow</SC> especially, when it snows <F>er</F> we tend to drive very carefully.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>. And I think <F>er</F> very <F>er</F> lenient or generous, should I say. For example, <SC>when we <SC>turn</SC> <R>ma</R> <SC>make left</SC> make</SC> when we make right turns,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>they let us go, even.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>um</F> they're <F>um</F> this patient.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And driving manners are generally good.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. Because I guess, in countrysides, when it snows or when it's icy,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I think all of us</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>realize</OL> how torturous it could be.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <OL>we drive</OL> very carefully.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. I see.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>

<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>

<B>by seven, I think.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>It's a private lesson?</A>
