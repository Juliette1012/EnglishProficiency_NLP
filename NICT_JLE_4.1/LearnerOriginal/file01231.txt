<B><OL><F>Um</F></OL> I don't really remember. I'd been to the normal <F>um</F> school and <SC?>I've been</SC?> I went to Japanese school on Saturdays.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. <R>I</R> I went during the middle of the kindergarten to the middle of the fourth grade. I came back so I could go to Japanese <F>um</F> elementary school starting in fifth grade in April. Then I went to the E S L for like <R>hal</R> half a year. And after that, <F>um</F> I didn't go to E S L and <SC>I</SC> there were lots of Japanese kids in our school but I didn't play with them but I play with the foreign kids.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <?>Then</?> why you didn't play with Japanese kids?</A>
<B>I don't know. But Japanese people didn't, like hung out together.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <SC>firs</SC> at first I was really having a hard time learning English and there was Japanese girl who just translating me everything. But <SC>when I s</SC> when I went to first grade, the teacher thought that was a bad thing and she told that girl not to speak to me in Japanese. So <SC>I</SC> like I think I cried a lot but I learned English.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. O K. Can you tell me about your family?</A>
<B>Family. <F>Oh</F> I have my dad, my mom and two little sisters.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Can you tell me about your father?</A>
<B>My father, he works something with computers and I went to America because of his job.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. Good. <F>Er</F> <F>oh</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>, what do you like to do in your free time?</A>
<B>Free time, I read a lot of comic books.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Um</F> use the computer and read English books.</B>
<A>Good. <F>Er</F> <SC>I happened to read <??></??> yesterday</SC> you know, yeah, yes, I <?>have</?> to read the articles in the newspaper but</A>
<B><F>Huh</F>.</B>
<A>Japanese comic books are very popular in America <SC>now</SC> right now. Is that right?</A>
<B>Yeah. I think so. <F>Well</F> when I was in America, there were only "Sailor Moon," "The Dragon Balls" but I don't know what's happening right now. But I think it's popular all around the world.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. Why do you think so?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I'm learning Spanish and I heard that "Crayon Shin-chan" is really popular in <OL>Spain</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> In Spain?</A>
<B>Yeah. But it's not for kids but for adults.</B>

<B>Yeah, I really love this school.</B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B>If I didn't come to this school and went to a normal Japanese high school, I wouldn't be able to speak English like this. Because in junior high, I started to <SC?>s</SC?> forget most of the English.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And I didn't listen to the English class where I could get like high grades on test. And when I first came to this school, I got in the <SC?>grade</SC?> group one <F>er</F> returnee class, I couldn't understand what <SC>are</SC> they <F>um</F> were saying.
