<B><F>Hu-huh</F>.</B>
<A>how do you usually take care of yourself?</A>
<B><F>Hum</F>. In my case, I prefer to stay home and just keep quiet. And I'm try to have <F>er</F> <R>warm</R> warm drinks, rather than cold drinks.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B>And, yeah, just take a rest. That is, yeah, what I usually do.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>

<B>Yes. <nvs>laughter</nvs> But it's O K, today is Friday.</B>
<A><R>Right</R> right. How do you usually enjoy your weekends?</A>
<B><F>Errm</F> as I am partly a housewife, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>erm</F> most of the weekends, I use for housekeeping things such as cleaning or washings, et cetera. And, especially in winter season, I like to go <F>er</F> for snowboarding,</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B>sometime.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. <F>Wow</F>. Great. Good. Now, <F>erm</F> where do you live?</A>
<B><F>Err</F> Yokohama city.</B>
<A>Far from here.</A>
<B><F>Hum</F> not too much, I think around forty minutes <OL>by train</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>. O K, O K. What does your husband do?</A>
<B>Actually he is in the seventh floor</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><laughter>working</laughter></OL> in the same company.</B>
<A>I see, I see. So, you met him here?</A>
<B><F>Huum</F>. <F>Hum</F>. <F>Uh</F>. Yeah. <OL><F>Erm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>That's good</OL>, that's good. O K. Now you said <F>er</F> <F>erm</F> <R>you</R> <F>er</F> you're interested in snowboarding. Can you tell me how you got interested in snowboarding?</A>
<B>How? Sorry. <CO><R>I</R> I <OL>couldn't</OL></CO>.</B>
<A><OL>How</OL> did you get interested in snowboarding?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. I see. <F>Err</F> first, <F>erm</F> one of my colleague, <F>erm</F> he was working in a marketing department. And it was, I think, five or six years ago. And he was <F>erm</F> given a <F>erm</F> snowboard as a promotional, <F>erm</F> how can I say, <R>gimmick</R> gimmick or <R>pro</R> promotion activity.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B>And, as he is not interested in that, he gave me that board to my husband. <.></.> <SC>And</SC> <F>er</F> so we tried to <F>er</F> start to use that.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> And, first one or two days, it was just sweating, <OL>and</OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>.</A>
<B>it can't never <F>er</F> turn rightly. But, <SC>once we fu</SC> <SC>we</SC> once I find to do right way, <F>er</F> it was complete different world from skiing.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><SC>That is</SC></OL> <F>erm</F> it's amazing, you know. <SC>The</SC> still <SC>it wa</SC> I was a <SC>gi</SC> beginner at that time. So the speed is not like that.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>The</OL> <SC>slope is very <F>erm</F> <R>loose</R> loose</SC>, I mean, <F>erm</F> <SC>it's <R>not</R> not too</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> slope <R>i</R> is <F>erm</F> not too strong, or, how can I say, <R>I</R> I can't explain <?>this enough</?>, but <F>erm</F> the speed is not high enough. But, still as I think, probably, <R>the</R> <F>err</F> the stance is different from skiing <SC>towards the</SC> <F>erm</F> <R>to the</R> <F>erm</F> to the ground or to the bottom, so <SC>I su</SC> <SC>fi</SC> I feel more wind</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B>than skiing</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> really</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><R>so</R></OL> so I was so excited about that.</B>
<A>I see. <R>Good</R> good. All right. That sounds interesting.</A>

<A>Why is that?</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F> <.></.> <F>uh</F> <F>um</F> maybe because I'm wearing normally casual <laughter>wear</laughter>. And <F>err</F> I think I would be more <SC?>bit</SC?> <F>er</F> relaxed if I go to casual restaurant. <F>Hum</F>.</B>
