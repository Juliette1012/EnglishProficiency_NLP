And she likes, I think, pet <F>um</F> a cat. Because she has <F>er</F> both cat and dog. <.></.> And <.></.> she's using a computer and typewriter.

I think <SC>she</SC> maybe she's a working in an office or office lady. <..></..> And <.></.> <F>er</F> she has a nice stereo, so I think she likes music to listen <F>err</F>. And the most important thing that <F>err</F> <SC>the</SC> <R>her</R> her room is arranged very well, because she has a window in front of <R>her</R> her desk.</B>

<A>O K.</A>
</followup>
</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A>I'd like to try a role-play with you. Please take a look at that card. Read it to yourself. It's in Japanese.</A>
<B><F>Uhu</F>.</B>
<A>And then when you're ready, I'll begin.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B><F>Er</F> excuse me?</B>
<A><R>O K</R> O K. Yeah. Good morning, sir. Can I help you?</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Erm</F> I buy a watch yesterday. And you recommended the Nike watch. But you know, <R>I was</R> <F>erm</F> <.></.> I was deciding <F>uum</F> the other one <F>erm</F> Nike and Addidas watch <SC>and</SC> but I think Nike watch is very nice but <F>er</F> Addidas watch has a stopwatch inside, and this watch doesn't have. So I want to change, because the price is same <F>um</F>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <R>you</R> you bought the Nike one.</A>
<B>Yes. But I returned and <R>I thought</R> I thought <R>I</R> I need <F>er</F> the stopwatch. Because <F>uum</F> <R>I</R> I always exercise and <SC>I wa</SC> I have to <R>keep my</R> keep my time <OL>so</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah but</OL> <R>you</R> you knew that when you were in the shop.</A>
<B>Yes. Of course, but this design looks very well and you recommended me. But I thought that I need the stopwatch <.></.> function <OL>so</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>On the</OL> way home?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>Suddenly?</A>
<B>Yes. Because I thought that <F>erm</F> I have to go to <F>err</F> ride my mountain bike and I have to <R>go to</R> go to the gym, and I have to <F>err</F> do my exercise, and I always keep my time so.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> basically, so <R>we</R> we have a policy against exchanges.</A>
<B><F>Uhu</F>. But I heard <SC>that they do</SC> that you do so. Because <R>you</R> you exchange everything almost. It was my friend I think, change his <SC>racket</SC> <R>tennis</R> tennis racket. And <R>he</R> <R>he</R> he had a brandnew one even though <R>the</R> the price was <F>err</F> different so.</B>
<A>I've never heard that before, so.</A>
<B>Really? I think I choose the wrong <F>erm</F> shop.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> I don't think so because I think <SC>you are a person that</SC> <F>er</F> you're very kind and you are very gentle. <R>So</R> <F>erm</F> so you can change the watch because I only, you know, use for a day so nothing changed.</B>
<A><F>Uum</F>. O K. So I'm persuaded,</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>if</R></OL> if it's the same price,</A>
<B><OL><F>Um</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>maybe</OL> I can change that.</A>
<B>O K. Thanks a lot.</B>
<A><??></??>.</A>
<B>O K. Thanks.</B>
<A><laughter>O K, thank you, <??></??></laughter>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Oh</F> how did you find service <R>in</R> <F>er</F> in the U S? Shop service.</A>
<B>Shop service? <F>Erm</F> I think they are not <F>er</F> kind as Japanese shop. <F>Erm</F>. <SC>But</SC> because I think Japanese <F>erm</F> customer service are very <F>err</F> trained and I think they know a lot of <R>pro</R> products, what is this and what the size is. And when I go to, you know, golf shop or go to sports shop, <F>uum</F> they even don't know what size it is, <F>erm</F> because if I bought something in U S size, it's a little bit different because my small is Japanese size.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F> <F>um</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> <SC>it does</SC> it's bigger than I expects so, even when I ask I'm Japanese and <R>I</R> I think I'm small and I think it doesn't fit even the size tells that I'm the same size, but <SC>they say</SC> they always say <SC>that's fi</SC> "That's the size.". <SC>and it doesn't se</SC> and "I think you are O K.". But when I try, always <F>er</F> different. So I think <R>they need</R> they need more information for foreigners or</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B><F>er</F> specially <R>who</R> who doesn't have <R>e</R> <F>err</F> enough size <R>for</R> for <SC>they</SC> what <R>they</R> they want <OL>so</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F> right</OL>. <F>Uhu</F> yeah, that's a good point.</A>
</followup>
</stage3>
<stage4>
<task>
<A>O K. One more thing, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, I'd like you to do. I'd like you to make up a story from these pictures.</A>
<B><F>Uhu</F>.</B>
<A><F>Erm</F> this goes, one, two, three, four, five, six. Make up a story.</A>
<B><F>Uhu</F>.</B>
<A><R>This happened before</R> this happened before.</A>
<B><F>Uhu</F>.</B>
<A>So please start "One day last week," and then begin.</A>
<B><F>Um</F>.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures and thinking for a while.</ctxt>
<B><F>Er</F> you mean, <R>I should</R> I should <F>err</F> tell the story <R>that</R> that happened last week?</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Er</F> last week, <F>er</F> I went to the station as usual on my way <R>to</R> <F>uum</F> to my office. <F>Er</F> <SC>when I</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>I usually go</SC> I usually take a train around eight o'clock <F>um</F> <SC>since</SC> because <F>uum</F> <.></.> my work starts at nine, and it takes around an hour or so. And when I went to the platform to take a train, <F>erm</F> the man <R>who st</R> who stand in front of me <R>hit my</R> hit my elbow, and I dropped <R>my</R> my briefcase. And suddenly, my briefcase <F>erm</F> <SC>drop</SC> <F>uum</F> <R>fell</R> fell down my <R>elbow</R> elbows and my arms. And it fell down <R>to the</R> to the lane. <R>And</R> <.></.> and <R>what</R> <R>what</R> what made me angry <R>that</R> <R>that</R> that a man said "What happened because I didn't nothing." but the man hit me, <R>so</R> so that my briefcase <R>fell down</R> fell down the lane. And <R>he</R> <R>he</R> he looks that something happened but <R>he's not</R> he's not serious. So I was very angry with him. <SC>And <R>I</R> I think that rapid train</SC> and after that, <SC>the rapid train</SC> the express train <F>erm</F> passed and <SC>my briefcase wa</SC> I thought my briefcase will be <F>erm</F> crashed, but <SC>wha</SC> <F>um</F> fortunately, <F>um</F> my briefcase was safe. So <SC>I</SC> <F>um</F> inside my briefcase. <SC>It didn't happen</SC> <R>it</R> <R>it</R> it didn't happen anything. And the train officer <F>er</F> kindly <F>err</F> take up my briefcase and gave it to me. So you know, my documents and files and everything was safe, so I was able to <F>uum</F> bring my <F>err</F> briefcase to my office. So that's a good story.</B>
