Because <SC>hotel</SC> for the breakfast, we have to start working about six o'clock in the morning. And when we work at night time, I have to finish my job about eleven or twelve o'clock at night. So it's very hard job.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> Could you tell me about your problem?</A>

</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>And now, I'll show you a picture.</A>
<B><F>Uhu</F>.</B>
<A>Here. O K?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>So could you describe this picture in detail?</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the picture and thinking for a while.</ctxt>
<B>The teacher is a woman and probably teaching mathematics. <F>Erm</F> some students are concentrated on this class. But most them are not. <F>Well</F> I think it's not <??></??> school because <.></.> the student age looks like different. Some of them are looks like in getting pretty older and some of them are pretty young. And, you know, some probably the <R>old</R> oldest man <R>is</R> is <?>asleep</?>. And another younger man <SC>was</SC> is drinking. And some young girl is talking each other. So they don't really concentrated on this. Maybe the mathematics, the content <SC>is difficult</SC> looks like difficult. You know, it's <??></??> thing. I don't like as well. And teacher <.></.> don't care much about the students' concentration. Simply she did the lesson. And <R>I don't</R> I don't know she cares either, you know, the students is understanding or not. <SC>The</SC> I think that <SC>she's doing</SC> <SC>she's just doing</SC> she just did and you know, not caring much about this. <SC>And</SC> but, you know, it's looks like a pretty new school as well. Because, you know, she's got the portable phone. But when I was a student, like in high school age, <laughter>there's no</laughter> portable phone.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>So</OL> it's <nvs>laughter</nvs> looks <SC>like very</SC> <.></.> pretty recently, looks like. <F>Well</F> <.></.> <F>uum</F>.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So compare to this picture, could you tell me about your high school life at high school?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> high school?</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> actually, I spent high school years in Netherlands. Because my father was transfered to Netherlands for three years. So I spend three years in Netherlands.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> so <SC>it's</SC> you know, of course, it's pretty <SC>difficult</SC> different from this picture. <SC>And</SC> but you know, in general, you know, we had a school uniform. And this picture, you know, don't have <R>school</R> school uniform. So it's little bit different. And also <SC>we</SC> of course, we don't have portable phone. <SC>We s</SC> we were not allowed to put the earphone as well. <SC>So</SC> but, you know, <SC>the co</SC> <R>the</R> the lesson <F>ee</F> they are doing, like mathematics, it's stressing. <SC>I</SC> probably, I did the same thing, you know, probably, the same thing as well. I can't remember right now, but <??></??> probably, I did the same thing.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>well</F> it's a difference, <F>well</F> and <SC>we</SC> of course, we went to school for the <R>same</R> same age.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. How about <F>err</F> students' attitude?</A>
<B>Attitude?</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhu</F> in the Netherlands</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Well</F> <R>my school was</R></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><F>well</F></OL> my school was in <F>er</F> pretty, you know, hard school, you know. Because it was international and everyone <R>has</R> has to study very hard</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhu</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>to graduate</OL> it, you know. So attitude is of course <??></??> and <R>we</R> <SC>we'll fail when</SC> <SC>if</SC> <R>you know</R> you know, if we do not study very hard, so attitude is very good. <F>Well</F> very <??></??>. And teacher was very strict, so if we do not concentrate, then, you know, she <SC>starts to</SC> you know, <F>well</F> start getting angry. <laughter>So</laughter> the attitude looks like pretty different from the picture.</B>
<A>I see. So did you enjoy your school life <OL>in there</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><R>Yes</R></OL> yeah. But it was very hard, too. Because, you know, I first went to Netherlands <SC>for</SC> when I was, you know, fifteen years old. So you know, it's very older. So we have to memorize <??></??> words to, you know, <R>we</R> we already did in Japanese. But, you know, I didn't know how to say in English. So like "photosynthesize" or, you know, "cell" or every single words, memorize again in English. So it was very hard as well.</B>
<A>But you speak English very well.</A>
<B>Thank you.</B>

<A>Now, <F>err</F> I'll show you another picture. <F>Uum</F>.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is choosing a picture.</ctxt>
<A><F>Oh</F> here you are.</A>
<B><F>Uhu</F>.</B>
<A><F>Err</F> there are six pictures. So please make up your own story from one to six. And this happened last week.</A>
<B><F>Um</F>.</B>
<A>So please start your story with "One day last week".</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures.</ctxt>
<B>One day last week, a man was driving a car. Should I say a man or? <CO><OL><F>Er</F> I was</OL></CO>.</B>
<A><OL>Anybody</OL>. <F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B>A man was driving a car. And also, at the same time, <SC>the</SC> another man was driving motorbikes <SC>but she</SC> but, you know, the man <SC>calling</SC> driving motorbike was also <F>ee</F> calling with girlfriend or something. And <F>well</F> <SC>she</SC> he was also talking <F>ee</F> during driving. So, you know, he's not very concentrated on the way <?>of view</?>. And unfortunately, then, the car and motorbikes was crashed. And <SC?>the</SC?> when it crashed, the portable phone was falling down. And <SC>tha</SC> it was actually broken. <F>Erm</F> because it was broken, and also motorbikes was little bit broken. It doesn't looks like, you know, all broken. So partially broken. And <SC>the man</SC> <SC>each other</SC> two men were getting angry, you know, of course.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And because, you know, for the man driving a car, <SC>it</SC> the bad person was <??></??> the man <??></??> driving, you know, motorbikes. Because, you know, he was <??></??>. But for the man driving the motorbikes is the <SC>good</SC> bad <R>one is the</R> one is the driving car. Because he broke the motorbikes and the portable phone. Probably, portable phone's not broken, I think. <laughter>Because</laughter> you know, you got all the data <F>erm</F> <SC>for the every</SC> telephone number for every friends or so. <laughter>So</laughter> maybe <R>he</R> he'll lost <laughter>some friend's as well</laughter>. And <.></.> therefore, they called police and, you know, <SC>they said what</SC> they said to policeman what they want to say about trouble. And finally, you know, <.></.> <SC>they go to</SC> <SC>they</SC> policeman made a document, you know, decide which one is bad, which one is <.></.> problematic. And finally, the motorbike was carried by trucks. <laughter>You know</laughter> and the man driving motorbike was standing alone for looks like <??></??> this result. <F>Uum</F> that's the end of story. <?>There you are</?>.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><SC>And</SC> <F>err</F> O K. So you said <F>err</F> transportation system is different</A>
<B><F>Uhu</F>.</B>
<A><F>um</F> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> to <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>And <F>err</F> how about <F>err</F> <R>Netherland</R> Netherland?</A>
<B>In Netherlands</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B><??></??> transport is pretty bad. But compare with other European countries, it's pretty good. It's said, you know, it's pretty good. Train late, you know, train's <?>fair bit high</?> they say. But, you know, for Japanese, <nvs>laughter</nvs> it's totally different from the European <OL>people</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhu</F></OL>.</A>
<B>Because, you know, when we, you know, travel Japan, the <R>tr</R> train always comes very accurate by about one or two minutes for each.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B>But, you know, in the Netherlands, five minutes late is, you know, usual. Five minutes late is</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs>.</A>
<B>usual. <SC>And</SC> but, you know, in European country, it's always the case. <F>um</F> if go to <R>south cou</R> <R>sou</R> southern country like France or Spain or Greece, <F>well</F> you know, <laughter>thirty minutes late is usual</laughter>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>You know, for the European people, <R>Dutch</R> Dutch train network is pretty good. But, you know, <SC>I</SC> you know, <SC>I travel</SC> I went to school by the train and buses. So buses are always, you know, pretty accurate and very convenient. But, you know, for the train, you know, five minutes late is usual. So <SC>you</SC> if we go to school, <R>I</R> <SC>I</SC> you know, I sometimes became late for school as well <SC>for</SC> because transport network. You know, <R>it's</R> <SC>it's</SC> you have an excuse, so, you know, it wouldn't be really problem.</B>
<A>I see. O K. Thank you very much.</A>
<B>Thank you.</B>

<B><F>Uhu</F>.</B>
<A>What are you going to do? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><F>Well</F></OL>.</B>
<A>Maybe it's the last time. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
