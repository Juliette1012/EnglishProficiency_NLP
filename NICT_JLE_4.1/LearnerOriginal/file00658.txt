<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. Are you ready?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. This is the telephone conversation.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Trun trun. Hello, A B C Travel, how may I help you?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> actually I participated in the tour. <F>Err</F> <F>eh</F> I thought it was very gorgeous. And <F>ur</F> however, when I participated in the tour, <F>urr</F> I found the so many things are different.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F></A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. And <R>I</R> I want you to compensate the money I paid.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. What's so different?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. For example, when I <SC>went</SC> arrive at the hotel, and <SC>I had</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>I</R> I think I ordered the suit room. But <SC>it was kind of similar bi</SC> <F>ur</F> it's kind of just a double room. There is no furniture or kitchen at all. So <F>urm</F> <R>I</R> I couldn't cook for my partner, and I couldn't stay there for many hours because the room is very narrow. <SC>So</SC> but <R>at</R> at first, I thought that I <F>urm</F> made a appointment at a suit room. But which was different.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>That's the fault of the hotel. Did you talk to the person in the hotel?</A>
<B>Yes, I talked <R>to</R> <F>ur</F> to the hotel manager.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>But <SC>he said <R>it</R> it</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>he said <R>we</R> we</SC> <SC>they</SC> he said he didn't have a suit room. And there is no point I could get into the <F>ur</F> suit room. But you know, <SC>the</SC> <R>as</R> as a plan, I've already ordered the suit room. So <F>ur</F> and I've already paid. That's the point.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Well</F> I don't know what to do.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. <F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> but <R>you</R> <R>you</R> you know, <F>ur</F> at first, <SC>the</SC> there's a statement that <SC>the</SC> <F>urr</F> if something wrong happened, <F>urr</F> the company <F>er</F> paid it back to me. So <R>it</R> it actually stated. So I think you should do something about it. <SC>You</SC> and you should talk to the I think the manager I think.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>O K. O K. I'll talk to my manager.</A>

And <F>ur</F> <R>I</R> I like <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> very much because <F>ur</F> <F>eh</F> <F>ur</F> it's very country side.

And he said that you know, <F>ur</F> "Look at my bike, you know, it's broken.". <SC>And the</SC> but <F>mm</F> the man got angry, too because <R>he</R> <R>he</R> he didn't pay attention to the car.

But I <F>ur</F> went backward a little bit faster so I hit the <F>urr</F> reared <F>ur</F> corner to the kind of white wall. So <F>urr</F> <R>my</R> my car little bit <SC>ss</SC> kind of scar.
