But after I got home, I thought, you know, this is not the <R>exact</R> exact thing I was looking for. So, I was wondering, you know, if I can get <.></.> refund or <.></.> change to something else.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. What were you expecting?</A>
<B><.></.> You know, I wanted to have a <SC>watch like really light</SC> light watch and have a dark color. But I thought <SC>this was</SC> this is the color I wanted. But maybe because the lighting and everything, <.></.> this is the <SC>quite</SC> little bit <R>dif</R> different from <.></.> the kind of color I wanted to get. So, I was wondering if I can get another color or if you don't have one. <.></.> Because, you know, <SC>this is</SC> I just <.></.> purchased it a few hours ago and <.></.> I haven't, you know, even used it yet. <CO>So, this is</CO>.</B>

<B>Yeah. I think, you know, <F>er</F> <.></.> people need to check <.></.> like <F>er</F> the thing they <.></.> wanted to get before the purchasing it. And <.></.> I don't think it's a good idea to buy a thing <.></.> like for the <R>first sig</R> first sight. <.></.> <F>Er</F>. People need to <.></.> think <F>er</F> and rethink if <R>it's</R> it is really necessary or <.></.> it is really a good buy.</B>

<task>
<A>Now, finally, O K. Please look <?>at this</?>. Make a story <?>using these six</?> pictures. And start with "One day last week".</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures and thinking.</ctxt>
<B>May I begin?</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B>O K. One day last week, at eight o'clock in the morning, <F>er</F> Mr. Suzuki <.></.> <F>er</F> is on his way to work as usual. And he got to the station. And <.></.> it is <.></.> really crowded <.></.> as the usual morning. And he was standing <F>er</F> next to <.></.> <R>two</R> <.></.> <F>er</F> two gentlemen. And <.></.> the two people were really engaged in <.></.> a conversation. And <.></.> one guy unintentionally hit Mr. Suzuki. And Mr. Suzuki dropped <R>his</R> <.></.> his bag <F>ern</F> to the <.></.> railroad. And Mr. Suzuki claimed to the person. But there was nothing they can do. So, <F>er</F> they were just <.></.> <F>er</F> standing. And there comes a train. And Mr. Suzuki <F>er</F> went almost crazy, because <.></.> he thought it might crash his <.></.> bag. Maybe <F>er</F> something <.></.> important was in his bag. And after passing the train, the bag was still there. And Mr. Suzuki seemed really relieved. Then came the <F>er</F> <.></.> personnel of the station. And <.></.> <R>pick</R> <.></.> picked <.></.> Mr. Suzuki's bag. And, again, everything was settled.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. O K. Very good. Thank you.</A>
<B>Thank you.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, if you were this guy, would you have done the same thing?</A>
<B><.></.> <F>Well</F> <.></.> no. I would ask, you know, the personnel at the station, <.></.> first thing.</B>
<A><F>Mm-huh</F>. Why?</A>
<B>Because it is dangerous to go down <.></.> to the <F>er</F> railroad and <.></.> because, you know, anytime a train <.></.> can come and <.></.> you might get killed.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. Right. So, what do you think of the incident happened in Shin-Okubo Station <F>er</F> several weeks ago?</A>
<B><.></.> Yes. It's really a sad thing. And <.></.> I <SC>usu</SC> <.></.> often feel like, you know, it's really dangerous just, you know, to stand on the platform of the station. So, a lot of <.></.> safety procedures <.></.> needs to be installed <.></.> in every station, I think.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <F>Mm</F>. For example?</A>
<B><.></.> For example, maybe <F>erm</F> <.></.> put <R>a</R> <.></.> a <.></.> wall, so people, even drunk people cannot <.></.> <SC>go down to the</SC> <.></.> go down. <SC>Or</SC> <.></.> <F>mm</F> and I also think like <SC>many</SC> <F>uh</F> more station personnels need to be at the platforms, make sure <.></.> for the safety.</B>
<A><.></.> O K. Thank you, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
<B><OL>Thank you very much</OL>.</B>
</followup>
</stage4>
<stage5>
<A><OL><F>Er</F> we are almost</OL> at the end of the interview. But what are you going to do this weekend?</A>
<B>This weekend? <.></.> Tomorrow I'm going to go to see a movie with a friend of mine. And <.></.> maybe we'll go <.></.> to eat lunch and <.></.> have really nice conversation, <OL>I hope</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL> good. O K. <F>Er</F> have a good time then.</A>
<B><OL>Thank you very much</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Thank you very much</OL> for coming in today.</A>
