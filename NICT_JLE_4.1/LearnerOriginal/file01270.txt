<B>Now, let's see, <F>well</F> I like to go to the supermarket</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>

So she brought her car, then <F>er</F> we drive the car. <R>Then</R> then we went to the <F>well</F> mountain. And <F>er</F> we made the camp <SC>near the</SC> near <F>well</F> side of the river. Then we cooked <F>er</F> delicious food and <F>eh</F> we enjoyed. But the suddenly, it was cloudy and it started raining.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Then, we decide to go back. But <F>well</F> it was really windy and <F>eh</F> heavy raining. We were so scared and <F>eh</F> we couldn't <F>well</F> find a hotel it's <R>near</R> <F>well</F> <SC>near the ss</SC> near the river, maybe. <nvs>sniff</nvs> Then we stopped by there. Then <F>er</F> we had a good, relaxed time.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> first time the we planned to do the camping. But the it was the another <laughter>holiday way</laughter>.</B>

<A>So these days, <R>out</R> <F>er</F> outdoor activities</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>become very popular among young people in <OL>Japan</OL>,</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>not only young people.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>But <F>er</F> <R>wha</R> <SC>what do you think</SC> <R>wh</R> why <SC>i ha</SC> it's happening now in Japan?</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Let's see. I think there are some <SC>reasons</SC> possible reasons, but the one thing is the people live in <F>well</F> Japan, especially the urban areas, they looks really tired because of their job <R>or</R> or study or maybe the atmosphere or environment.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Then the they want to see probably the green and the friendly <??></??> or peaceful place. Maybe that's why. Also the some like a children or <SC>young people</SC> young generation, <SC>they don't</SC> I'm nor sure, but <F>er</F> <R>the</R> they might not have a chance to do the outdoor activities when they were young.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Maybe that's why they want to try or challenge them to do.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Then maybe they prefer to do or can relax from that. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
