<stage1>
<B>Good morning.</B>
<A>My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I ask your name?</A>
<B>My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><?>Hi</?>. How are you?</B>
<A>Fine. How are you, today?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> I just woke up <OL><laughter>so</laughter></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>I don't feel <OL><laughter>anything actually</laughter></OL>,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>but <?>I'm</?> fine.</B>
<A>O K. Great. All right. So, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, where do you live?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> I just live near <H pn="school name1">XXX03</H> where's <F>urr</F> <F>well</F> <.></.> two hundred meters <OL>from here</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL> that close.</A>
<B>Yeah. <OL>So</OL>,</B>
<A><OL>Good</OL>.</A>
<B>very close. I don't have to use any train, in morning rush hours, so very happy with that.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><?>But</?></OL> before that, I just moved, <F>er</F> here two years ago, because I changed my room. <F>Urr</F> because of my, kind of exchange <F>urr</F> study in Australia, so then, I thought, "<F>Urr</F> the place is not really convenient for me, so <F>urr</F> maybe I can change <?>the room</?>. Chance to change after the one-year off.".</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F> that's great. So you are junior <OL>now</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>No</OL>, I'm senior now.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> you're. <OL>Senior</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>But</OL>, yeah, I already spend two years here.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Ah</F> did you start job-hunting yet?</A>
<B>I already finished it.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> finished it?</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL> so you get a job?</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> please tell me about it</OL>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <??></??> finally, I got <F>urr</F> yeah, kind of, yeah, job I really wanted to have. The job is <F>urr</F> called <F>urr</F> manual director</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B>which is a kind of director <.></.> of organizing the manual booklets and <F>urr</F> brochures. So I <R>wa</R> wanted to be a writer</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B>at beginning, so I <F>uhm</F> searched for some publishing companies, <SC>then I thought</SC> <F>er</F> and I also started <F>err</F> kind of part-time job at a <R>publi</R> publishing company. But, I thought, <F>urr</F> "Maybe my ideal is bit different from the truth.". So I thought, "<F>Oh</F> I have to find a different way or different field.". Then I got the job at <H pn="others1">XXX04</H>, <OL>so</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.</A>
<B><H pn="others1">XXX04</H> is kind of entertainment company.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So, maybe I can enjoy the creating entertainment things as well, <OL>not</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.</A>
<B>only writing.</B>
<A>I see. O K. Great. But, did you have a hard time getting <F>er</F> <?>or</?> finding <OL>a job</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> As you know, newspapers <?>told</?> so hard special for girls. Like <F>ur</F> in a usual job-hunting system, there are three or four interviews before they hire. And like, first step, second step, that's fine, and, you know, I can tell them my experience and also how <?>did I</?> success for study or activities, and so on. So, that was, yeah really, actually successful, but the final interview was problem.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Like they pick first boys, because they need the boys first, I suppose. And then, if they have still some room,</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>they would just hire girls. So, I felt really unfair at that time, so <R>I</R> I was not <F>er</F> emotionally stable. But now, <F>mhm</F> there are some companies like <H pn="others1">XXX04</H>, like very equal. Now, my future co-workers are really equal between male and female, so that's <?>really nice</?>.</B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. Thank you very much. Now I like to show you one picture.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>All right? O K. Please look at this.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>And please describe it.</A>
<B><R>May I</R> may I start?</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Well</F> <F>uhm</F> <.></.> the time is three o'clock afternoon, and one boy just came into a <F>urr</F> electric <SC>company</SC> <F>er</F> no, shop. <F>Urr</F> and there are some audio sets and video camera, the T V's, telephones, <SC>kai</SC> maybe a kind of <F>urr</F> independent <??></??> shop. And the owner <F>urr</F> talked to the boy, and <R>he</R> he suggested <F>urr</F> the watch on a showcase. Maybe <SC?>few</SC?> I think the boy asked the owner, <F>urr</F> where the watches are, and then he indicated the place. And <SC>he was choosing</SC> he is choosing one of them. <F>Urr</F> look same, but colors are different, so <R>he</R> he is going to choose the color finally. And <F>urr</F> actually, he doesn't really want to <F>urr</F> buy anything else. He is very concentrate on a watches. And now, also he still have some questions about watches, like waterproof or things like that.</B>

<followup>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>?</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. Thank you very much. So, you said you <?>already</?> get a job <OL>at</OL></A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</B>
<A><H pn="others1">XXX04</H>?</A>
<B><H pn="others1">XXX04</H>, yeah.</B>
<A>O K, so <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> is very famous and popular. <OL><F>Urr</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Urr</F></OL> sort of. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <R>Why</R> why do you think <F>urr</F> so <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> is so popular?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> first, <SC>usually</SC> <F>uhm</F> most time, <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> starts new products. <F>Urrr</F> first in a world. Some people said <F>urr</F> <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> is a experiment mouse because <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> try everything first. So <SC>sometimes</SC> <R>a</R> I mean most of time, they fail to <R>pro</R> produce new products, but <SC>the</SC> like, a few products are really successful, <OL>so</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.</A>
<B>they can earn the money from that. For example, <H pn="others2">XXX05</H>, do you know <H pn="others2">XXX05</H>?</B>
<A><laughter>No</laughter>.</A>
<B>It's a kind of robot.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And, robot pet. And <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> started the product, and everyone else said, "<F>Urr</F> robots are not really, you know, popular. Especially, <SC>it's</SC> the shape is like a dog. So, I think the Japanese prefer <F>urr</F> real dogs to robots dogs. <SC>So</SC> but <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> started anyway, and then they got really <.></.> great successful story of that. And then, they started selling on the web site. Only on a web site, so you can't buy at shop. So, that make it more precious and the, you know, rare.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>Some manias really wanted to have. <SC>So</SC> but <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> only sold <?>a</?> first a thousand sets in the world. <OL>So</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>there's big competing. And then <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> thought, "<F>Oh</F> so many people really wanna have that.". <SC>Then</SC> so they started, like big <F>err</F> project <OL>about</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B>that. So, <?>but I</?> I always think <F>urr</F> you know, <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> is hoping to <F>urr</F> have new products, and <F>er</F> also they <F>urr</F> have idea of dreams, <?>life</?> so maybe that kind of feeling synchronized with the some people who really believe <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> is best.</B>

<B>O K.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the picture and thinking for a while.</ctxt>
<B>O K. May I start?</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B>O K. One day last week, I <?>really</?> wanted to cook for my friends, but in fridge, <F>urr</F> I didn't find any <F>urr</F> food. <SC>So</SC> and <F>ur</F> it's not really good because my friends're coming soon, so I decided to go to a supermarket by car. And <F>urr</F> then I got there, and <F>ur</F> I start shopping. And <F>ur</F> some foods are really <F>urr</F> cheap and reasonable, so I bought a lot. <SC>And</SC> <F>er</F> but, <F>urr</F> that's not so bad, because <F>urr</F> they had kind of saling in day so when I paid it <F>err</F> at register. And then, <F>urr</F> I was very lucky because I took car with me. That means I bought too much. <SC>If I come</SC> <F>ur</F> <F>er</F> if I came on foot, maybe I couldn't carry that much. But, <F>urr</F> finally, I got <F>urr</F> <SC>those fu</SC> lot of foods in a car, and <F>ur</F> then I went back. And I started cooking, and <F>urr</F> my friends coming, so I was very happy because <F>urr</F> <R>I</R> I'm really good at cooking, so I really wanted to show off. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>

<A>That's good. O K. <?>Fine</?>. <F>Urr</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, do you think she is a housewife?</A>
<B><F>Mhmm</F> yeah. Very similar to my mother. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Ahh</F></OL>. O K. But, do you want to become a housewife</A>
<B><OL><F>Urr</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>in the</OL> future, <F>ur</F> after working <OL>for a company</OL></A>
<B><OL><R>I say</R></OL></B>
<A>several years?</A>
<B>I say, "No" <OL>because</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Ah-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><F>urr</F> I really like <F>urr</F> maybe, <F>uhm</F> going out for working outside. <SC>Even some</SC> you know, recently, some peoples are saying like SOHO. It's working at home, but still I want to go out and work outside, because, you know, I can <F>urr</F> absorb everything <R>like</R> <SC>like</SC> maybe, I can find lots of friends outside, and also like knowledge from friends or bosses, <?>and</?> co-workers. So, that make me really happier and feel, you know, "I'm advancing <SC>every day</SC> day by day.". But, if I just in a home, and waiting for a husband, maybe that's really stressful for me. And, also sometimes, I might make <F>urr</F> my husband stressful as well, because <SC>he</SC> in his mind, always he think, "<F>Urr</F> my wife is waiting for me till late night.". Or <SC>just he</SC> <SC>even he</SC> if he <SC>come back</SC> comes back, and <F>urr</F> <SC?>he</SC?> like I can't tell him about my story because every day is exactly same, like</B>
<A><F>Ah-huh</F>.</A>
<B>start cooking,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>cleaning, and <?>the</?></B>
<A><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>like</OL> that. But, if I go out, like every day is different, <OL>so</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B>I can talk and <SC>the</SC> you know, can enjoy the conversation with husband, so we both can enjoy the life, I suppose, if I continue working. <OL>But</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>maybe if I have a baby,</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>I might quit.</B>
<A>Quit. <laughter>O K</laughter>. <OL><laughter>All right, thank you very much</laughter></OL>.</A>
