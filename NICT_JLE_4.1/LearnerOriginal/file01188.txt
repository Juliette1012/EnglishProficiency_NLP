<A>Good morning.</A>
<B>Good morning.</B>
<A>My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I ask your name?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>O K. Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Fine.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>How are you today?</A>
<B>Good.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>It's</OL> very hot.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> <F>ah</F> do you work in this office?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> no. <F>Ahm</F> my office is at the corner of the <F>ah</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>. I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Could you tell me more about your job?</A>
<B>O K. <F>Ahm</F>. <F>Well</F> I originally belong to the aerospace group at <H pn="company name1">XXX04</H>. But <F>erm</F> as right now, I am working for a company <H pn="company name2">XXX05</H>. And I belong to the first section of that <F>ah</F> company. And I'm handling <F>ah</F> program called <H pn="others2">XXX06</H>,</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>which is</OL> the <F>ah</F> radar of the <H pn="others3">XXX07</H>. And I import that radar and <F>er</F> deliver it to the <F>ah</F> <H pn="others4">XXX08</H> which is <F>uh</F> <H pn="others5">XXX09</H>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see. <F>Ah-huh</F>. But how has your <F>ah</F> job changed, compared to previous division? You said something <OL>like that</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Oh</F></OL> this is my forth year <SC>in the</SC> in this company <OL>and <F>ah</F></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B>my <F>ah</F> previous <F>ah</F> days here at <H pn="company name1">XXX04</H> was <F>ah</F> basically handling the year budget for the section, so <F>er</F> I didn't <F>ah</F> go out <F>ah</F> <F>aaa</F> much, you know, <F>ah</F> meeting <F>ah</F> <SC>the com</SC> <F>ah</F> the customers.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>But <F>ah</F></OL> right now, <F>ah</F> I'm pretty much out <F>er</F> going outside, <F>ah</F> contacting our customers.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Do you sometimes entertain your clients?</A>
<B>Yes, I do.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>. How do you do that?</A>
<B>Entertain. <F>Erm</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Oh</F> we do a lot of things. But <F>ah</F> basically, we go out and <F>er</F> have a dinner. And <F>ah</F> some alcohol will <F>ah</F></B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>help us a lot.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>. I see. Do you feel any difficulties entertaining your clients?</A>
<B>Difficulties.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Ah</F></OL> no. <F>Ah</F> basically <R>I</R> I usually have fun entertaining them. <F>Ah</F> having <F>ah</F> some good food, <F>ah</F> couple of drinks.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> you <F>hm</F> see a different side of the customer, having dinner and having drinks with them because <F>er</F> <R>in a</R> in a conference room, it's like <R>ver</R> very <F>ah</F> strict and <F>ah</F> you know, everyone's very serious.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>But <F>ah</F></OL> if you go out and have dinner, couple of drinks, <F>er</F> things loosen up and you can see the <F>er</F> <?>wait</?> <SC?>by</SC?> the private side of customer's face. And <F>ah</F> yeah, <SC?>it can get quite</SC?> I enjoy it.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> I <OL>see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A>But it sounds like <SC>it</SC> it's a really, really Japanese style of doing business. Don't you think so?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I go to the States <F>ah</F> maybe once every three to four month but I see Americans do that kind of <F>ah</F> entertainment.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Going out</OL> for dinner, <OL>couple of drinks</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B>So I don't really say that very Japanese style but <F>ah</F> I think it's <R>very</R> very common <R>in</R> <SC>in</SC> <F>ah</F> worldwide.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>O K. All right. Thank you very much. O K. Then, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> <JP>san</JP>, <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>ah</F> it's very hot outside.</A>
<B><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</B>
<A><F>Ah-huh</F>. Do you like summer?</A>
<B>No.</B>
<A>No? <F>Ah-huh</F>. Why not?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> it's too hot.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Ahm</F></OL> <F>ah</F> the humidity in Japan is <F>ah</F> too high. <F>Ah</F> it's very uncomfortable. <F>Ah</F> and I don't do any, what do you call it, those <F>ah</F> sports in summer.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I don't swim</OL>. I don't go to the <F>ah</F> ocean. I don't <F>ah</F> do anything. I just kind of <SC>s</SC> try to stay <R>in</R> <F>ah</F> you know, <F>ah</F> in a cooler place. But I like winter better because <F>ah</F> I've been playing ice hockey for about <F>ah</F> twenty-two years now. <R>And</R> and comparing summer with winter, <F>ah</F> <SC>I get</SC> I can definitely say that I like winter <OL>much, much</OL> more.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>. I see. O K. Thank you very much.</A>  
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>Now, I want to show you this picture. Please describe this picture for me.</A>
<B><.></.> <F>Well</F> it's <F>ah</F> the classroom. A woman standing here <SC>is</SC> I think, is a teacher <F>ah</F> teaching, I think, this is math. <F>Ah</F> there are six students <F>ah</F> in this picture. <F>Oh</F> actually I think there're seven. <F>Oh</F> one student <SC>can</SC> I can identify a hand. <F>Ah</F> to include that, it would be seven students. <F>Ah</F> to start from the front row to the left, <F>ah</F> a student is <F>ahm</F> just sitting, looking outside, chewing gum, <F>er</F> making a bubble. <F>Ahm</F> the one in the middle seen in the front, <F>ah</F> he is concentrating on the blackboard. <SC>He is</SC> <SC>I think <F>ah</F> very</SC> <F>ah</F> I think he is listening to the teacher. And <SC>he is</SC> I think he is learning. The one on the right side, a girl <F>ah</F> is, <F>ah</F> this is not a calculator, I think this is <F>ah</F> what is this, maybe a cell phone. <F>Ah</F> she might be calculating by using her <R>ce</R> cellular phone or she might be checking her e-mail, but <F>ah</F> I'm not <?>really</?> sure. But I think <F>ah</F> she is not <SC>conce</SC> <SC>ce</SC> concentrating. In the second row, <F>ah</F> in the middle, a student is listening to his, I think, a Walkman. He has an <SC>earphone</SC> <SC>hea</SC> earphone or a headset on. He is drinking a juice, I think. <SC>Might</SC> <F>well</F> it looks like a tea. And <F>ah</F> he is closing <SC>eye</SC> his eyes. <F>Ah</F> he is not listening to the teacher. <SC>The woman sitting</SC> the girl sitting <R>left</R> <SC>left</SC> <F>ah</F> far left side in second row, she is talking to a friend who 's sitting behind her, having good time. She has a mirror on the desk. <F>Ah</F> she maybe just <F>ah</F> polish her nails. And the girl sitting right behind her is <F>ah</F> just talking to her and just having a good time.</B>
<A>O K. <OL>Thank you very much</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah, that's about it</OL>.</B> 
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. So, why do you think some students are not listening to <F>ah</F> the teacher?</A>
<B>Why do I think they are not listening? I don't know. I think <.></.> maybe because they don't have any interest in math. Maybe <R>the</R> <F>ah</F> the lecture is boring, <F>ah</F> it's so by the book maybe. <F>Ahm</F> maybe <F>ah</F> I don't know. <SC>It's</SC> I would way this is high school, so <F>ah</F> <F>um</F> I don't think <R>ma</R> many high school students <F>er</F> enjoy math, so <F>ah</F> I don't know. Maybe just lack of interest.</B>
<A>O K. So if you were this teacher, <F>er</F> what would you do to attract more of students' attention?</A>
<B>What would I do? <F>Ahm</F> I would ask more questions to the students to <F>ah</F> get them involved <R>in the</R> in the classroom. <F>Ah</F> <F>ahm</F> yeah. To draw attention, I would <F>ah</F> solve some <F>ah</F> difficult questions to them, <F>ah</F> make them think. <F>Ah</F> maybe try <SC>to</SC> you know, a pop quiz or something. <F>Ah</F> <SC>write <SC>some</SC> <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> what do you say, <F>ah</F> maybe some questions</SC> write some questions on the blackboard, have the students come up, <F>er</F> solve the problem. <SC>I think you just</SC> basically just get them involved.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>

<task>
<A>Now, let's have a role-play. O K.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is choosing a card.</ctxt>
<A>Right. O K. This is your card. Please read it to yourself and when you are ready, I will start the conversation.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>May I help you, sir?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Ahm</F> <nvs>sigh</nvs> I recently came here and <F>ah</F> <.></.> <SC>I bought this</SC> <F>ss</F> <SC>I am</SC> <F>ahm</F> I bought this book. And it wasn't actually what I <F>ah</F> had in mind, and <F>ah</F> I would like to <F>ah</F> turn it back, maybe <F>ah</F> get refund of it. <F>Ah</F> is that possible?</B>
<A>I am really sorry, but it's against our policy.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> <R>a policy</R> a policy <R>of your</R> of your company?</B>
<A>Right. <F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I see. <F>Ahm</F>. Would it be possible to give maybe like a fifty-percent refund?</B>
<A>I'm very sorry. We can't do that.</A>
<B>Is that a policy? It that written down <OL>in a policy</OL>?</B>
<A><OL>Pardon me</OL>? Right. <F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>It's a written down policy.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Ahm</F>. <F>Well</F> <F>ahhh</F> <.></.> <SC?>try</SC?> allow to say this, <F>ah</F> but <F>ah</F> <SC>I would really not think</SC> I would really think that that policy is not a very good one because <F>ah</F> many people do <R>make</R> <F>ah</F> make mistakes <F>ah</F> purchasing items. <F>Ah</F> when wondering a shop, they may <F>ah</F> assume that this <F>er</F> item is what they think they are, but when they <R>bring</R> bring it home and <F>ah</F> look through it, <F>ah</F> sometimes people find out that <F>ah</F> <SC>these items aren't as much</SC> <F>ah</F> <R>the qu</R> the quality of that item is not what they had in mind. And <F>ah</F> when they make those mistakes, <F>ah</F> <SC>they</SC> I think people should have an option <OL>to make a refund</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Right, right, right</OL>. But this is a book. O K. We don't know whether you didn't like the book or you've already read it. So we can't <R>do</R></A>
<B>O K. <F>Well</F>. <OL><CO>Actually</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>er</F> do this</OL>. <F>Uh-huh</F></A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><OL>We have all these people</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>. All right. <F>Ahm</F> <F>well</F> instead of a refund, I found this <F>ah</F> <R>the</R> the book that I really did have in mind. And the price is about the same. <F>Ah</F> would it be possible to exchange it?</B>
<A>Exchange. O K. <F>Ahm</F> I'm just a part timer so I don't have any authority to say yes or no.</A>
<B>So may I talk to your manager?</B>
<A>O K. <F>Ah</F> now he is in a meeting.</A>
<B>He's in a meeting. <F>Ah</F> can I get an appointment with him?</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> I don't know.</A>
<B>You don't know.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>O K. Then, <R>I'll</R> I'll <F>er</F> give you my <F>ah</F> cell phone number. If you <F>er</F> get touch with him, could you please <SC>c</SC> <F>ah</F> let me know.</B>
<A>O K. O K. So I'll tell him. <F>Ah</F> and <F>ah</F> <F>well</F> when he gets back, it's O K, <F>ah</F> maybe he will get back to you, right?</A>
<B>O K. <F>Ah</F> thank you.</B>
<A>Thank you very much.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. O K. Have you had a similar experience?</A>
<B>No.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I didn't.</B>
<A>You didn't. O K. Then, <F>ah</F> when you go shopping, what kind of things do you keep in mind? What is the most important thing to buy things?</A>
<B><R>When I go shopping</R> <F>well</F> <SC>when I go shopping <SC>I really</SC> <SC>I just</SC> <R>I</R> <SC>I don't</SC> I</SC> <F>ah</F> when I go shopping, <R>I don't <F>ah</F> windowshop</R> I don't windowshop.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I don't</OL> browse around. <F>Ahm</F> <SC>I have</SC> <SC>like I go throgh magazines, I see something</SC> <F>ah</F> <nvs>tsk</nvs> I go to a <R>s</R> store, I try to find that item. If I find it, I'd buy it.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And I don't compare with things, and I just <F>ah</F> know what I want. And basically <F>ah</F> I have no problem with that in the past.</B>
<A>O K. All right. Thank you very much.</A>
</followup>
</stage3>
<stage4>
<task>
<A>Now, I'll give you <F>um</F></A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is choosing a card.</ctxt>
<A>O K. Please <SC>take another</SC> <nvs>cough</nvs> take a look at another picture. And this time, please make a short story using these six pictures. But <OL>this happened last week</OL>,</A>
<B><OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL></B>
<A>so please start your story with "One day last week".</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> this is me? <CO>The</CO>.</B>
<A>Yeah, it can be you or somebody else.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>You</OL> could name him.</A>
<B><.></.> <F>Well</F>. <R>Looking</R> looking at this picture, <F>ahm</F> if I start from number one, a guy is walking to a <SC>s</SC> train station. <SC>It's <F>ah</F> eight in the</SC> I think it is eight in the morning, so rush hours. All right. Number two. He gets to the platform. He drops his <F>ah</F> bag and <F>ah</F> the hand carry lands on the <F>er</F> rail taking the whole track. <F>Ah</F> in number three, he is <F>ah</F> talking to the guy next door. <F>Oh</F> number two, he bumped into a gentleman on a platform talking to his, I think maybe, a colleague or something. And I think he is blaming on that guy that his <F>ah</F> elbow hit him, and that is why <SC>they</SC> his <F>ah</F> bag fell down <R>to the</R> to the <F>ah</F> rail. <F>Ah</F> number four. The train comes. <SC>And the</SC> <F>oh</F> <F>well</F> it goes over the bag. But fortunately, since the bag is between the rail, <F>eh</F> <F>ah</F> the bag didn't get smashed. <F>Ah</F> <F>eh</F> and in number five, <SC>they</SC> the guy who dropped the bag was relieved. And number six, <R>the</R> <F>ah</F> <SC>the</SC> <F>ah</F> I think is this is an officer or maybe a employee of the <R>train</R> <F>ah</F> train company comes and <F>ah</F> <SC>gives</SC> picks up the the bag for this gentleman and gives it to him from below.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. Thank you very much. Then, <nvs>cough</nvs> so look at him. So how <SC>could have</SC> could he have avoided that kind of <F>ah</F> accident?</A>
<B>How could he have avoided? Maybe just being more careful not to <F>ah</F> bump into someone or hold onto his bag more firmly.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>. O K. <F>Ahm</F> do you commute by train?</A>
<B>I do.</B>
<A>O K. So what is most uncomfortable stuff on the train?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> just <nvs>sigh</nvs> too many people on the train, <F>ah</F> get smashed every morning and <F>ah</F> it's even hard to breathe. Maybe it's very hot outside and <SC>the</SC> <F>ah</F> sometimes air condition is not very <F>ahhh</F> good enough and <F>ah</F> it's too hot. <F>Ah</F> everyone is sweating. Yeah. The worst case is when you have a very <F>ah</F> sweating guy standing next to you and <F>ah</F> his <F>ah</F> body temperature is very hot and <F>er</F> it's very uncomfortable.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Then</OL>, what do you do in the train, if you <OL><??></??></OL>?</A>
<B><OL><SC>I don't do a</SC></OL> I don't do anything. I just <F>ah</F> bear it. And it takes about thirty minutes <R>t</R> <F>ah</F> to get to my <F>ah</F> destination. So I just bear it and <F>ah</F> keep eyes closed and just wait for thirty minutes go by.</B>
<A>O K. Then if you were the kind of the person that the <R>rail</R> railway company, then what would you do?</A>
<B><nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>Ahm</F> <SC>I like to have the</SC> <F>ah</F> <SC>I like to</SC> I'll probably increase more trains so that the <F>ah</F> crowdness would decrease.</B>

<B>Thank you <OL>very much</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL> do you have any plans for this weekend? Today is Friday.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> this is Friday. <F>Ah</F> this weekend, actually, <F>ah</F> I'll have to go to the office. <F>Ah</F> I'm going to the States for this training thing about two weeks.
