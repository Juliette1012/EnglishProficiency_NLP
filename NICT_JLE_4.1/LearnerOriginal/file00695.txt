<stage1>
<A>O K. <..></..> So my name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. So what's your name, please?</A>
<B>My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>How</OL> are you today?</A>
<B>I'm fine. Thank you.</B>
<A>O K. Good. So are you a student?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F>. <R>No</R>, <R>no</R>, no. I'm a housewife, and I work part time.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see. So then what do you do as a part timer?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F>. Actually, I'm teaching English.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL></A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>. I teach English in the evening.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Would you tell me more about that?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. <SC>I s</SC> <F>ur</F> I work for <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> English conversation school. And <F>ur</F> it's <F>ur</F> one of the biggest schools in Japan. And <F>ur</F> I teach <F>mm</F> high school students, college students and business people and housewives. <F>Mm</F>. But I mainly teach adults. <F>Mm</F>. And I only teach <F>ur</F> students who are in the basic level. <F>Mm</F>. But it is very fun.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A>I see. And then what do you like, and what do you dislike about your job?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. <F>Well</F> <F>mm</F> <F>ur</F> the best thing about my job is <F>ur</F> to meet many people, and <F>ur</F> I like to communicate with various kinds of people. And <R>I</R> I can feel I can help people <F>ur</F> by teaching English. That's the best thing. And the worst thing is <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> that it takes too long to prepare for each class. <F>Mm</F>. And I'm not paid very <F>well</F>, I guess. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. It's a fun job, but <F>ur</F> it takes long time to prepare. <F>Mm</F>. <R>That's the</R> <F>mm</F> that's the point I don't like about <OL>my job</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><?>Yeah, I think so</?></OL>. <F>Ur</F>. Have you <SC>had</SC> ever <F>ur</F> have any trouble when you teaching?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. <F>Well</F> yeah, of course my English is not perfect. So sometimes <SC>I</SC> <F>urm</F> I'm asked questions <F>ur</F> that I don't know the answer of the questions. <F>Mm</F>. And sometimes some students have <F>urm</F> a trouble to communicate with others. So it's sometimes difficult for me <R>to</R> <F>mm</F> to manage the class. My class is <F>urm</F> quite small, <SC>only four</SC> only three <?>of</?> four people. <F>Mm</F>. But they are adults. <F>Mm</F>. So it's sometimes very difficult to <F>ur</F> manage <OL><?>older people</?></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F> I see</OL>. O K. So then on holidays, what do you usually do?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I don't have any particular <F>ur</F> hobbies. But <F>mm</F> <F>well</F> I like listening to music. <F>Ur</F>. So when I have a free time, I go to a <SC>vi</SC> <F>ur</F> C D rental shop, and rent some C Ds, my favorite songs. And I listen to <F>ur</F> the music at home. And sometimes I go to karaoke with my friends.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. I see. So then <F>ur</F> do you do anything with your family?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F>. Yes. I live with my husband, and my husband is very <F>um</F> outgoing person. And he likes outdoor activities. So I sometimes go hiking with my husband. And actually, <SC>I</SC> <F>ur</F> my husband and I climbed Mount Fuji this summer. <F>Mm</F>. It was a great experience for us.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>So now, I'm going to show you a picture. <?>So and</?> would you describe this picture, please?</A>
<B>O K. <F>Mmm</F>. <.></.> See. I think this is a picture of <F>mm</F> the place in the suburbs. And <SC>I s</SC> there is a <F>ur</F> house, <F>ur</F> it's a quite big house. <F>Mm</F>. And <F>mm</F> let's see, in front of the house, there is a street. And <F>mm</F> <.></.> I think it's <F>mm</F> early in the morning. A man is jogging, and some children are playing <F>ur</F> with a ball. And I see some dogs. And some people are standing and chatting with <F>ur</F> their friends. <F>Mm</F>. And <R>I see a car</R> <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> I see a car in front of the house. And there is a cat on the roof of the car.</B>

<B><F>Urm</F>. Let me see. <F>Urm</F> <.></.> <F>mm</F> I live on the <SC>bus</SC> very busy street. And I live in the apartment. <F>Mm</F>. So my place is <F>ur</F> much more crowded than this place. <F>Mm</F>. And my streets are busier. There are more cars <SC>in my</SC> on my <R>st</R> streets. <F>Mm</F>.

But <F>ur</F> Taro <F>urm</F> didn't agree with what the man was saying because Taro thought <SC>it was his fault</SC> it was the man's fault because <F>ur</F> the man <F>ur</F> was so careless when he was driving his motor cycle.

<A>So why you don't like driving?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I took a driver's license in America when I was living there. And it was easy to drive in America because <SC>the land is so wide</SC> <R>the road is wi</R> the road is wide, and <F>urm</F> <SC>it</SC> yeah, it was easy. But in Japan, <F>ur</F> it's so scary for me to drive because <F>ur</F> especially streets <F>ur</F> in Tokyo are very crowded. <F>Mm</F>. And the traffic rules seem <F>ur</F> very complicated. <OL><F>Mm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>. I see. O K. And what do you think the people who <F>ur</F> talk on the cell phone while they are driving?</A>

<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL> I see.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>And What is the important thing, <F>ur</F> the good manners when you use cell phone?</A>

And <R>you have to</R> <F>ur</F> you have to think about others. <F>Ur</F>. Some people might <F>ur</F> be <SC>annoyed by you</SC> <F>ur</F> annoyed by your cell phone. <F>Mm</F>.
