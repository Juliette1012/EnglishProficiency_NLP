But, when I actually experienced the tour, after the tour and during, and there were some <F>ah</F> differences with your <SC>exp</SC> advertisement and actual tour.

But, actually, <SC>your schedule</SC> the trip schedule was a little bit tight. And we have not much options to look out during our stay in the course. So, compared with your <SC>as</SC> advertisement <SC?>to</SC?>, we cannot understand why the service was so poor and different with your original's plan.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. But, why didn't tell your problem to tour conductor?</A>
