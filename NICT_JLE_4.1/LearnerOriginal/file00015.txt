<A>O K, good morning. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>.</A>
<B>Good monrning. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>O K, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, how are you today?</A>
<B>Fine. I'm just kinda sleepy.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And you?</B>
<A>I'm fine. Thank you very much. You sleepy because?</A>
<B>Because <.></.> <F>ah</F> maybe because of the weather.</B>
<A>How do you like winter?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I like winter because I was born in winter. Actually, yesterday was my birthday.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Congratulations.</A>
<B>Thank you.</B>
<A>O K. And, <F>uh</F> <R>you</R> you say you like winter. What do you like to do in winter?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I don't like the cold weather, so I stay at home and stay in <JP>kotatsu</JP>. <.></.> Should I explain what <JP>kotatsu</JP> is?</B>
<A>Could you?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> It's a table <.></.> that has a <F>um</F> heater in it. And <R>you</R> <F>um</F> you put a kind of <.></.> <JP>futon</JP> over it. And you go inside and get warm, and eat orange, tangerine <.></.> and watch TV. <OL>That's <JP>kotatsu</JP></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>It's a winter life style</OL>.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Umm</F> very nice. You said you were born in winter. <R>Where</R> where were you born?</A>
<B>I was born in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> Prefecture.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <OL><??></??></OL></A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>. I only stayed there for about two months. After that <F>um</F> I had to move to <F>uh</F> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> prefecture, which is <.></.> my mother's <F>um</F> hometown? Hometown. Yes. <F>Well</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> <R>pre</R> prefecture was my father's hometown and there was kind of <F>um</F> mother and mother-in-law stuff going on, so we had to move.</B>
<A>I see. So, you moved around quite a bit?</A>
<B>Yes. After that <F>um</F> I moved to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> because of my father's job, then I moved to <F>um</F> <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> and that was when I was four years old.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <OL>a lot of moving</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And I stayed</OL> there for six years. And I came back to Japan when I was ten. And first I stayed in <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>. <F>Um</F> it was <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> City. And then I had to move because of my father's job. I had to move to <F>um</F> <H pn="others7">XXX09</H>. Yes and then to <H pn="others8">XXX10</H>. And then now I am in <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> Prefecture again.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. What do you think of the disadvantages and advantages of moving around so much when you were a child?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I have a brother, and my brother always <F>um</F> claimed and cried about moving again and again. <F>Um</F> but for me, I like moving because <F>um</F> <.></.> <F>well</F> <.></.> I can make many friends. And I think that's more advantage. And for my brother, he had <F>um</F> trouble making friends over and over, and I think that's disadvantage.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F>. You say it was easy for you to make friends.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>What do you think of the secret of making friends easily?</A>
<B><F>Ummm</F> secret <.></.> Maybe not <laughter>a secret</laughter>, but <F>um</F> <.></.> <F>um</F> I was in the age of <F>um</F> that has ability to write letters. So, I had <F>um</F> a lot of ways to keep in touch with my friends, but my brother was so little. He didn't have to write letters. So, <.></.> <F>mm</F> so he didn't have any ways to get in touch with his friends. <F>um</F> Like <F>um</F> <.></.> like children in the first grade in elementary school doesn't <F>um</F> <.></.> doesn't call his friend far distance. So, that way my brother couldn't get in touch with his friends until he got older.</B>

When you go into the room, <F>um</F> then first you may see a desk. And on the desk, there is a typewriter, computer and some white <R>sheet</R> sheet of paper.

<B><F>Oh</F> really. <F>Um</F>You see. <F>um</F> I was coming down to the stairs to the station and I think <F>um</F> I bumped into a person and I think that was you. And if you didn't bump into me, I would have been on the train right now.</B>

<A><laughter>O K, thank you</laughter>. Thank you very much, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. That's an unusual one. You bumped into me. <laughter>On train in the morning</laughter>. Tell me when you do travel, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> how do you like to travel? By train, by plane?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I actually, I don't have any chance to travel these years. <F>Un</F>. But if I travel, <F>un</F> I would like to go on trains or bus. don't like airplanes so much.</B>
<A>Is that some sort of phobia?</A>
<B>Phobia?</B>
<A>Some sort of fear of planes?</A>
<B><F>Umm</F> It could be. <SC>When <.></.> I get on the airplane</SC> as soon as I get on an airplane, I get really sleepy. I never see the views out of the windows so.</B>
<A>That's wonderful. You can sleep all the way.</A>
<B>Yes. <F>um</F>. <SC>Because</SC> <F>mmm</F> not because <F>um</F> I heard from a person at <F>um</F> my driving school. <SC>He said</SC> he told me that when you get really scared or feared, you get sleepy. So maybe <R>I</R> <R>I am</R> <SC>I am feared</SC> <R>I'm</R> I am feared of the plane unconsciously.</B>
</followup>
</stage3>
<stage4>
<task>
<A>Right. O K. <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I envy that situation. O K one more thing we have to do <F>um</F> I'd like you to take a look at the sequence of pictures, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. And I'd like you to make up a story based on these pictures from one to six. Like that. Sorry. And this happened before. So could you start "one day last week"? And then begin the story.</A>
<B><.></.> O K. May I start?</B>
<A>Please.</A>
<B><F>um</F> One day last week, when I was walking down the street to my university. I saw a car coming from the left. And from the right, there came a motor cycle. And as I watched, they crashed. And <F>um</F> <SC>they got</SC> they both got off the car and the motor cycle. And as I was watching the situation, <SC>the motor cycle</SC> <F>uh</F> the person who was on the motor cycle, was more angry than the person who was on the car. So, the people just like me watching the crashed and arguing called the police and the police came. And the three of them, the man who was on a car and the one who was on a motor cycle and the police <F>um</F> talked for about ten, twenty minutes. And then it was settled. The settlement was that <F>um</F> the person who was driving the car <F>um</F> wasn't <R>looking</R> <R>looking</R> <F>um</F> looking at motor cycle <.></.> in time. So he missed the motor cycle coming. So <F>um</F> the person <SC>on the</SC> <R>who was</R> who was on the motor cycle <F>um</F> had was <F>um</F> the person <.></.> who <.></.> was riding the motor cycle <F>um</F> settled this <F>um</F> accident <R>to</R> <F>mmm</F> <SC>to</SC> <F>mmm</F> or the policeman said that <F>ah</F> the person who was on the car should take <R>resp</R> responsibility. So <F>um</F> I think the motor cycle is going to be repaired by the insurance from the person who was on the car. Or for that day, <F>um</F> the motor cycle was broken down so the person who was <F>um</F>driving the motor cycle had to walk to his work place for that day.</B>

And the other is you have to actually ride a car and practice the <.></.> practice the techniques. Yes, <R>they have</R> they have the both sides. Like <F>um</F> one is like <F>um</F> taking classes at school, and the other is actually driving <R>in</R> inside the school and outside the school. Yes.

But normally, <F>um</F> my friends almost all have had their license <F>um</F> in two months.</B>
<A>So it can be quick.</A>
<B>Yes. Can be quick.</B>
<A>But not for you.</A>
<B><.></.> Yes.</B>
<A>Never mind. It took me much longer.</A>
<B><F>Uhh</F>. How long?</B>
