<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Erm</F> I've been <.></.> teaching at this school about <.></.> ten years. And <F>er</F> <F>well</F> this is the second school for me.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> <.></.> there are a lot of beautiful trees around this school. <SC>And</SC> but the students are not so <F>well</F> motivated. <F>Erm</F>. So I have to think about the contents of the class very <??></??> <?>neatly</?> in order to involve the students <F>er</F> in the classes. So, yeah, everyday is a very hard day for me. <OL>So</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. <F>Hm</F>. So can you describe your classroom?</A>
<B>My classroom?</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <R>I'm</R> I'm in charge of <?>one-six</?> class now. <F>Erm</F>. But <F>er</F> relatively, compared to the other classes, relatively the students <SC>are</SC> <F>erm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>well</F> listen to what I'm talking to. <SC>So</SC> <F>erm</F> and <F>er</F> rather well disciplined. Some of the students are a little bit selfish. But <F>erm</F> they tend to listen to what I'm talking to <SC>very</SC> <F>erm</F> in a <F>mm</F> very friendly way. <CO>So</CO>. And I really like <laughter>them</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Great. O K. <F>Er</F>. Do you live near this school?</A>
<B>Yes. <SC>Ten</SC> probably, about <SC>twenty</SC> <F>er</F> fifteen minutes <R>ride</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>mm</F> ride <F>er</F> on the car from school.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. What's the area like?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. In <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City?</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. Can you tell me more about the city? I'm not familiar with <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</A>
<B><H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City?</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Well</F> to tell the truth, I don't like <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City. <R>I'd ra</R> I'd rather live in <F>er</F> the suburb of <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>'Cause <F>erm</F> <.></.> I often go to <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> <F>er</F> on holidays. So it's not so convenient for me to live around here. But <F>er</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is a very traditional city. And <F>er</F> I went to <F>erm</F> <F>mm</F> senior high school in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. So, <.></.> <SC>yeah</SC> yes, <SC>the</SC> there are a lot of <F>er</F> old castles and <F>er</F> shrines. But <F>er</F> <laughter>for me</laughter>, <R>I don't</R> I don't like this city,</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>so much.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>So you</OL> said you go to <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> <OL>sometimes</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. <OL>Yeahm, yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>What do you</OL> do there?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>er</F> <R>I</R> <F>hm</F> I sometimes go to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. But <F>er</F> it's impossible for me to live around <F>er</F> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>, 'cause it's very expensive and <R>I'm <F>er</F> working</R> I'm working at <F>er</F> <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> Prefecture. So <F>er</F> it's very <F>er</F> inconvenient for me to <F>eh</F> live in the center of <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But just <R>I</R> I wanna have a convenient life. 'Cause around my houses, <SC>there are</SC> <.></.> there aren't so many stores which attracts me, such as <JP>udon</JP> stores and <F>er</F> <F>erm</F> <SC>side dish</SC> <R>side</R> side-dish stores. <SC?>You mean</SC?> I mean, <F>well</F> I'm quite busy. So <SC>I</SC> sometimes I can't prepare my supper.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I want to buy something <F>er</F> delicious. And <SC>I</SC> there is a <R>su</R> <F>er</F> <R>supe</R> supermarket called Inageya. But <F>er</F> <R>the</R> <.></.> the stocks which are sold there <F>er</F> <.></.> don't attract me so much. So,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><R>I want to</R> I want to have a store <SC>such as</SC> <F>er</F> selling some delicious side dish to <F>er</F> decorate my <F>erm</F> supper.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. Yeah. O K.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>Now, the first thing I'd like you to do is to describe <.></.> this picture.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>O K? Please tell me what you see.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC>there are</SC> <.></.> <SC>there</SC> three couples are having the, probably, dinner. <F>Erm</F>. Very gorgeous restaurant. And <F>er</F> one woman is playing the piano. And the time is seven o'clock. So <F>erm</F> <R>the</R> <R>the center</R> <.></.> <SC>the center couple <SC>i</SC> are</SC> <.></.> <F>uh</F> <R>one</R> one waiter <R>is</R> <F>er</F> is recommending one probably very expensive <F>er</F> wine to the <R>c</R> center couple. And <F>er</F> <R>one</R> <.></.> <SC>one</SC> they already drink? <F>Uh</F> one of the men <SC>is</SC> has already <R>drunk</R> <F>er</F> drunk wine. And probably <SC>he said</SC> <.></.> <F>er</F> <SC>he is as</SC> he was asking the name of the wine. So the waiter is explaining <F>er</F> what kind of wine it is. So <F>mm</F> maybe <F>er</F> <R>this</R> this man liked this wine. So <SC>they are</SC> <R>they</R> they seems to me that <SC>they really enjoy</SC> they <SC>are en</SC> really enjoy their <SC>supper</SC> <F>uh</F> dinner <F>hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>in a gorgeous restaurant.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So <F>erm</F> do you have a favorite restaurant in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> or <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>?</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>. <F>Well</F> <F>erm</F> <.></.> I don't eat meat. So <F>er</F> <SC>I'm not</SC> <F>erm</F> I mean <SC>I don't</SC> <R>I</R> I'm not a strict vegetarian. But <F>erm</F> I don't eat meat. So <F>erm</F> I'm looking for some <F>er</F> restaurants <R>which</R> which will attracts me. But <F>er</F> <F>er</F> at the <R>pre</R> present moment, <R>I</R> I haven't found such a <F>mm</F> <.></.> nice restaurant. But <F>er</F> <F>er</F> I'd rather take some Italian food rather than <F>erm</F> the other foods. 'Cause Italian foods has <F>er</F> various kinds of menus,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>er</F> <R>which</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> which don't include meat. So <SC>I li</SC> I love Italian <OL>food</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. So why are you avoiding meat?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. 'Cause <F>erm</F> <F>erm</F> there is some reasons for me. <SC>'Cause</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> and from <F>er</F> healthy point of view, it's not very good <SC>for me</SC> <SC>for us to</SC> <F>mm</F> for us who eat meat. And another reason is a religious reason.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>'Cause if <F>er</F> the animals were killed and <SC>they are</SC> when they were killed, they got lot of pains by killing. So if we eat meat, <F>er</F> we have to also get some burden <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> <F>uh</F> <R>o</R> of their pain.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So which cause <.></.> me some troubles in the future. So,</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I believe in that religious <OL>faith</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>So <R>I don't</R> I don't want to eat meat.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <OL>I see</OL>.</A>
