But it's a very little crush so <.></.> for me it's not <R>so</R> so big thing, but for them, who actually crush, it's not small thing. It's quite big thing, it seems. So they are quarreling quite hard, it seems. And <..></..> in this case, <.></.> damager is <.></.> person who ride on scooter. And <..></..> <F>mh</F> person who damage the scooter ride on the car, and they are quarreling and quarreling. But <.></.> just by themselves <F>mh</F> <R>this problem was not</R> <.></.> <F>mh</F> <SC>this problem was not</SC> <.></.> <F>mm</F> solution could not make out, it seems, so <SC>they seems</SC> they seemed to decide to call police who can provide one solution. And <R>people</R> <F>mh</F> <SC>people</SC> no, sorry, police listened <.></.> to the voice of each of them. <.></.> <R>And finally</R> <..></..> and finally, <.></.> scooter was brought somewhere <R>by the</R> by the truck. <F>Um</F> just from this picture, <.></.> <R>I cannot</R> I cannot tell the person who ride on car compensate for it. But actually, <F>mh</F> just <.></.> <SC>from <F>mh</F> his expression</SC> I mean <SC>from the per</SC> from the expression of the person who ride on scooter <SC>is</SC> <F>ah</F> were a little bit serious. <.></.> So I think <..></..> the person who ride on the car <.></.> did not compensate, so person who ride on scooter have to <.></.> pay for himself, it seems. And that's all.</B>
