</task>
<followup>
<A>Thank you very much, Is there anything you want to buy now?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> yes. I want to buy <F>ah</F> <F>um</F> <.></.> <F>mm</F> <.></.> video recorders because <F>um</F> a friend of mine have one and <F>em</F> actually <R>last</R> last night <R>we</R> <F>ah</F> <SC>we had</SC> <F>ah</F> we made a <JP>nabe</JP> and at the party and <F>ah</F> friend of mine <SC>took a pictures about</SC> <nvs>cough</nvs> sorry, <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>ah</F> took a pictures of that party and in the morning <R>we saw</R> <F>ah</F> we saw that videos and it is very funny, <nvs>laughter</nvs> so I want to buy it.</B>
<A>I see. Good. O K. Now, so we have many this kind of products that are made in China or Southeast Asia countries. What do you think of those products?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> you mean the qualities or something?</B>
<A><OL>Anything</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Anything</OL>? <F>Mm</F>. I think <F>um</F> the reason why the most of the Japanese companies <F>er</F> made some products in Chinas or <SC>some</SC> in somewhere else because <F>mm</F> <R>if we</R> <SC>if we</SC> if they do it in Japan it would cost very much. But <R>if</R> <SC>if they made</SC> <F>mm</F> if they make some products <R>in a</R> <SC>in a chi</SC> in China, for example, <F>um</F> there are a lot of people who want to work <R>and</R> and <F>um</F> recently I saw <F>um</F> <R>T V</R> T V documentaries and <SC>at that</SC> in that program <F>um</F> the Chinese people said <F>um</F> <SC>they</SC> that they very <R>wanted</R> wanted to work for a Japanese company. And I don't know why but <SC>they</SC> <F>mm</F> I think <R>they</R> they love Japan and <R>if</R> if they work for the Japanese company <F>mm</F> in China <R>it is</R> it is kind of <.></.> how can I say, <F>mm</F> <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> <R>they</R> they can get <R>some</R> <.></.> <F>ah</F> some advantages <SC>if</SC> <F>um</F> <SC>when they want to</SC> <F>mm</F> <SC>they</SC> when they look for another job <R>it would</R> <F>um</F> it would <R>help</R> help them <R>to</R> <F>mm</F> to get the job so <F>mm</F>. And as to the qualities, <F>um</F> I think <SC>it is</SC> <F>ah</F> there is <F>mm</F> no problem and the <?>tip</?> is very important for the students.</B>
<A>I see. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Good. Thank you very much.</A>
