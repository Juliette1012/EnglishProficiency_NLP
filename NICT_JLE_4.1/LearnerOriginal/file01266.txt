<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And we usually have summer performance every summer.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And for that occasion, we prepare one year. And my teacher was a <R>chore</R> choreographer of Takarazuka</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>

<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And please</OL> describe this picture.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> it's a nice restaurant. And <F>um</F> three couples are eating dinner. And a waiter is introducing a wine. And the man at the center table is tasting. They are chatting very nicely. And also <F>erm</F> this must be a very good restaurant because there is a live piano performance. And only couples are here. I think it <SC>'s a</SC> must be a very nice place for a date.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>?</B>
<A>O K. Thank you.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So please compare this restaurant with the restaurant you often go to.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> first of all, because my son eats a lot, we cannot afford to go to a nice restaurant like <OL>that</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>I'm sure after we ate dinner at <?>these</?> restaurant my son would say, "So what can I eat?". <OL><laughter>Yeah</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>So we usually go to a Chinese restaurant nearby,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>which is very cheap and also <SC>very</SC> <F>um</F> provides big <F>er</F> quantity.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. But <F>er</F> on a special occasion like your own birthday or <OL>your</OL> daughter or son's birthday, <F>er</F> how do you celebrate?</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <F>Um</F> we usually celebrate at home.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>With a birthday cake.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I'm determined to go to a nice restaurant like this on my own. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> So <F>er</F> please tell me about your last birthday.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> my last <SC>bar</SC> birthday, <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> <SC>we usually had a</SC> as usual, we had a party at home. And my daughter <SC>ele</SC> <F>er</F> selected a birthday cake <OL>for me</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>Also many candles. But of course we cannot <F>um</F> offer all the candles</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>well</F> of my age because we need too much. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>You cannot see the cake any more.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>So</OL> just maybe four or five. And they sang a song</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>and then</OL> I blew off. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Er</F> good afternoon, ma'am. How may I help you?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I bought this dress <OL>yesterday</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. <F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But then I found a little hole here. You see?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> yeah.</A>
<B>So I want you to give me the next one for this one.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> but didn't you try it on?</A>
<B>Yeah. I tried it on last day. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. But it's very strange that nobody noticed it.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> because it's a very small hole.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I'm sure</OL> we didn't have any chance to look at it.</B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>After</OL> I got home,</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I tried it</OL> on again and then found it.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> but it's very small, so nobody will notice it even if you wear it.</A>
<B>But it's new.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Brand new. Why do I need to <F>er</F> have a new dress with a hole? I don't like it.</B>
<A>It's really small. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>You can just, you know, sew it up.</A>
<B>I hate sewing.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> O K. But unfortunately this was the last dress. And we don't have exactly the same one in the store right now.</A>
<B>I wanna get refund.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> but that's against our policy.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I have a receipt here.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. And on the back of the receipt, it says "<SC>All final</SC> all sales are final.".</A>
<B><F>Well</F> O K. Then can I get another dress in your shop?</B>
<A>O K. So it will be a different one. Is it O K?</A>
<B>Yeah. It's O K.</B>
<A>O K. So why don't you take a look. And if you find something, please let me know.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. All right. O K. Thank you. This is the end of the role-play.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. So have you ever had <F>er</F> any problem when you are shopping?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> yeah. Often.</B>
<A>Often?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Please tell me one of your experiences.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>um</F> it often happens, but after I got home, I realize that the dress I bought doesn't fit <F>um</F> you know, outside. Because</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> when you try, you usually try it inside the shop. And the lighting is different. But when you go outside, it looks different. And I don't like that <nvs>laughter</nvs> look on outside. So I sometimes go to the shop again and ask them to change it.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But then I'm often persuaded by the clerk. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And I come back. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <F>Oh</F> really?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. So <F>er</F> where is your favorite shop to buy your clothes?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> it's in the nearest department store. I usually go to the same shop.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I'm a catch for them. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> People like shopping in a department store and some people like shopping in a private, small store. <F>Hm</F>. What do you think is the advantage of buying things in a department store?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I go to a private shop in the department store. So personally I like private shops.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So <F>mm</F> what do you think it is the advantage of buying things in a private shop over department store?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>um</F> I think it's much better because <F>um</F> <.></.> the sales ladies working there knows your taste.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And when they get what they think you might like it, they'll call you. And arrange it for you.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> I like the atmosphere that three or four ladies are surrounding me and <SC>dress me</SC> try to dress me. And just, you know, cheer me up. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <?>And</?> it makes me feel very good.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I definitely think private shops are superior than those <OL>department stores</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>. I see. Interesting. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Is that so? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Yeah.</A>

<task>
<A>All right. So lastly, there are six pictures from one to six.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>And please make up a story based on these six pictures. And please start your story with "One day last week," because this happened before.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures.</ctxt>
<B>O K. <F>Um</F> one day last week, two girls are preparing for camping. They planned to stay overnight in a tent in a nice suburb near the river. They build up tent and tried to cook dinner for them. But suddenly, the rain started. And <.></.> it became very gusty, <SC>so that</SC> <F>uh</F> so the tent is blown off and they cannot stay near the river any more. It's very dangerous. So they made up their mind and got in the car and drove back. But on their way, they found a nice hotel nearby. And the sky is having a lots of lightening. It must be very dangerous to drive a car even in that severe weather. So <SC>s</SC> <R>th</R> they decided to stay at the hotel. After they had bath and relax in their hotel <R>ro</R> room, they are now enjoying the view of severe weather outside.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. <OL>Thank</OL> you.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. So why do you think people enjoy outdoor activities?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I think people are born to like nature.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> They came from <laughter>there</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. O K. So do you enjoy outdoor activities yourself?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> sometimes, yes.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So how do you feel <.></.> when you go back to the place where you're born? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Um</F> it's really fun to do camping with your friends and watch stars at night because you cannot enjoy it in the city. Also if you have children, <F>er</F> you can see your children enjoying themselves in the nature.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And that gives you a great joy.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I think while the kids are small, I often went there.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. But we can see stars in the city. How is it different from seeing stars in the nature?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>well</F> it's totally different because <F>um</F> seeing stars in the countryside gives you a very, very romantic feeling with lots of stars <SC>as if you are</SC> as if you have memory of ancient times.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. Like Greek people should have seen it and thought about things. And now you feel you are united</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>to the human race.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So did you go camping when your children were small?</A>
<B>Yeah. We often went there. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>So</OL> what did you enjoy most?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <SC>s</SC> as I told you, stars. And also <F>um</F> <.></.> fishing.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. I usually don't like fishing but on the occasion of camping, it's very fun. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. All right. Thank you.</A>
</followup>
</stage4>
<stage5>
<A>So we have come to almost the end of the interview.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>So are you going back to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. How long will it take to go back?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> forty minutes. My <OL>son is</OL> waiting for me.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>And he likes cakes.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So I think I buy a nice cake at <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Eh</F> <SC>so</SC> do you sometimes bake?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yeah.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Only for my <laughter>children</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <CO>So <OL>how</OL></CO>?</A>
<B><OL>I hate</OL> cooking but <SC>I hate</SC> <F>uh</F> I like making cakes.</B>
<A>I see. Have you decided where to get some cake?</A>
<B>Not yet. But there must be <SC>s</SC> nice ones at <OL><H pn="others4">XXX06</H></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><H pn="others4">XXX06</H></OL>. There're plenty of shops.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
