<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. So could you tell me more about your club activities?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> we basically play the instrument and <SC>most of our</SC> most of the songs are Japanese songs like "<JP>Sakura</JP>".</B>

<B>And he's in elementary school.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>

<A><OL><laughter>What do you mean</laughter></OL>? <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Well</F> like <F>um</F> we always fight a lot.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <.></.> yeah, he <.></.> kind of kicks me a lot. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Really?</A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. Do you like traveling?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> not really.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But if I travel, I like using the trains.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Not the shinkansens but like the normal trains.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Er</F> tell me about the most memorable trip <OL>you had</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Memorable trip</OL>. <F>Um</F> <.></.> <F>oh</F> <F>um</F> when I lived in the U S,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>um</F> I went to the Grand Canyon with my family.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And I really loved <R>the</R> the landscapes.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>It was really beautiful.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><?>Yes</?>.</B>
<A>I see. O K. <F>Er</F> you said <R>you live</R> <F>er</F> lived in the States.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>When did you come back?</A>
<B><F>Hm</F> about three years ago.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. I see. <F>Um</F> how was the life in the States?</A>
<B>It was really different, I mean, the school gave us a lot of homework <OL>than</OL> the school in Japan.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And it took me a lot of time to finish everything. <?>Yeah</?>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I was really busy.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. How did your lifestyle change after coming back to Japan?</A>
<B>I think I became really lazy</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>because</OL> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>because <F>well</F> maybe it was only my middle school but they didn't give us much homework.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So we really had a lot of free time to play <?>out</?> so <?>I think I got really lazy with doing all my work in school</?>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So which do you prefer, living here or living in the States?</A>
<B>That's <?>really</?> hard to say. <F>Um</F> I really like my life in the U S but I was too busy so <SC>it was</SC> the schools in U S gave us no time to play and have fun on our own. Maybe it was better to stay in the U S because we had more time to <F>um</F> study a lot.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And giving us homework, I think, that's something that we have to do.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I think I prefer the U S</B>
<A><laughter>O K, <OL>I see</OL></laughter>.</A>

<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Because they couldn't go home, they decided to <F>um</F> go to a hotel.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And actually, the storm was getting so harder, so they couldn't go home. And as they were driving, they saw a hotel.</B>

</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. <F>Um</F> if you travel <F>er</F> with your best friend, what kind of plan would you make?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I would definitely use a train.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>um</F> <..></..> I think I would go to the sea rather than the mountains.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <.></.> maybe <F>um</F> just kind of swim or go around the places, like if they have a museum or something out there, I like to go there, too.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <F>Oh</F> sounds like you <laughter>really</laughter></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>like traveling by trains. <F>Um</F> what are some merits to travel by train?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>well</F> <F>um</F> if you wanna go somewhere <SC>far away</SC> by car, I think you would always use the highway.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And most of the highways have really <F>um</F> big walls around and we can't really see <SC>the</SC> <F>mm</F> all the landscapes.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But <?>if we</?> use a train and if it's not like those fast shinkansen trains, we can see all the trees and the mountains and all those</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>landscapes, so I think that's one thing that's really good about normal trains.</B>
