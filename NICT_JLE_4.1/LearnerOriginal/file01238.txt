<task>
<A>O K. Now, I would like to show you a picture. <F>Mhm</F> O K. Please describe this picture.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> it's winter and people are skiing. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Urm</F> <?>so</?> <F>ur</F> most of people are skiing, but one person is snowboarding. And a guy fell <nvs>laughter</nvs> off his ski.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> on the left, children are throwing snowballs at each other and having fun. And some people made a snow man.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And few people are in a rest house. And I think they're drinking coffee or <SC>something</SC> something warm. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> more? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>

<A>Do you ski?</A>
<B>I ski.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. <F>Urm</F> could you compare your favorite ski resort with this ski resort?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> I went skiing on the Rocky Mountains.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>And <R>this</R> <R>this</R> this skiing place looks kinda small to the one that I went. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Urm</F> but <SC>it</SC> <SC>I guess it</SC> they're having fun so I guess it's a good skiing place <nvs>laughter</nvs> to go to. <F>Urm</F> I see all the people skiing here but when I went, <SC>I saw</SC> <F>ur</F> like mostly the people I saw were snowboarding.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So that's one of the difference. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>oh</F> where I went, they didn't have snow fights. If they did, they probably got in trouble because <SC>that's not</SC> you're not supposed to do that on the <R>ski</R></B>
<A><F>Oh</F> <OL>really</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>skiing</OL> place. Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <R>I didn't see</R> I didn't see any children playing that.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Do you also enjoy snowboarding?</A>
<B>I <laughter>tried</laughter> snowboarding but I didn't do <F>well</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

<B><F>Ur</F> can this person be me?</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B>O K. One day last week, I was walking to the station because I had to go to work. It was eight o'clock and since it was so early in the morning, there were so many people and it was very crowded. <SC>I was waiting for the train to come</SC>. And wait, I was waiting for the train to come and so I was behind a man who was lining up before me. <F>Well</F> he was talking to another person and he didn't know that I was behind him. So he lifted his arm quite hard and fast that the luggage that I was holding, it fell off to the <SC>tra</SC> wait, <R>t</R> <R>trail</R> trail, <F>oh</F> man, I forgot what this is called.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> it fell. <F>Urm</F> I got so angry and start yelling at the man. But the man just said, "I don't know.". And raised his hands. <F>Well</F> ten seconds later, the train came and it ran over my or I thought it ran over my luggage. But thank God, it didn't. And it was just lying there like it was before the train got there. <nvs>cough</nvs> I called the train man and told him what happened. And when I told him, he picked it up for me and <SC>gave it</SC> gave me the luggage. Everybody was happy and so was I.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> O K.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>Thank you</OL> very much.</A>

<A><F>Oh</F> <F>well</F> <F>urm</F> <R>if you lost</R></A>
<B><nvs>cough</nvs></B>
<A>if you lost something on the train, what would you do?</A>
<B><SC>I will go up to <R>the</R> <F>ur</F> the</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> I will go up <R>to</R> to the man that works at the train station.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>And ask him what I should do because I lost something.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. <F>Ur</F> do you come to the school by train?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F> yes, ma'am.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> did you ever have a trouble or did you ever seen <SC>a tou</SC> <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> a problem on the train?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I once saw two guys fighting on the train. And like a month ago, I lost my pass <SC>to the</SC> <laughter>to this</laughter> school</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>on the train. And I thought someone stole it, but</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I found out that <SC>I</SC> <F>urm</F> like it fell on the train.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And so when I when I went to the train station to see if I lost it, they had it. So <nvs>laughter</nvs> I got it back.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><R>A</R> I was very thankful. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> when you lived in the States,</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>what kind of <SC>tranfu</SC> <F>ur</F> transportation did you often use?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> I lived in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> so we didn't have trains.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <SC>they</SC> most of the time, car was our transportation. And to get to school, <SC>it was</SC> <SC>it</SC> <R>I</R> I took the bus. But other friends, like since they're already able to drive, yeah, they drove to school.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Urm</F> <R>which</R> which transportation system, I mean in the <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> and in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>, do you prefer?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> since I don't like the trains, I prefer the one in States. Like I like cars so I prefer cars. But trains are really, they are very <F>um</F> useful.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>Because <F>well</F> <R>I did</R> I didn't have a driver's license so when I lived in the States, if my family was sick, then I couldn't go anywhere. But here, although like your parents are sick, you can just take the train and meet your friends.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So yeah, <SC>there</SC> <R>I</R> I guess if I have to choose, then a car. But <F>ur</F> I like the both. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. Do you want to get a driver's license here in <OL><H pn="others3">XXX05</H></OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>But <SC>you have to be able</SC> you have to be eighteen, <R>I</R> I think, to drive. And it's expensive here so</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I <laughter>don't know</laughter>.</B>
