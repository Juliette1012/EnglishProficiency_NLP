<ctxt>The interviewer is taking out a card.</ctxt>
<A><F>uh</F> excuse me. O K. So, please make a story from one to six. And this happened last week. So, please, starting with "One day last week".</A>
<B>O K. <.></.> One day last week, <F>umm</F> Mister Ito <F>umm</F> <.></.> went to the <.></.> station and took a <.></.> train as usual. But <F>er</F> on a platform, <F>umm</F> <.></.> by accident, he dropped <SC>her</SC> <F>uh</F> his briefcase <.></.> <F>erm</F> <.></.> from the platform to the <R>rai</R> <.></.> railway. <F>Er</F> <.></.> <SC>he blamed to</SC> <.></.> he blamed <.></.> a man who was standing next to him <.></.> for <R>the</R> <.></.> the accident, because <.></.> <F>er</F> <SC>the man's elbow <.></.> was</SC> <.></.> <SC>no, elbow</SC> <.></.> <F>eh</F> the man hit <.></.> Mister Ito with his elbow <??></??> <F>urm</F> <.></.> And the briefcase dropped off <.></.> from the platform.

And finally, <.></.> <F>erm</F> staff from the <.></.> station <F>erm</F> <.></.> <SC>go</SC> went down to the <.></.> railway and picked up his briefcase. So <.></.> finally, Mister Ito could <F>erm</F> <.></.> take back his briefcase safely. But <F>erm</F> <.></.> people should be very careful <F>erm</F> on the platform, because something like this <F>erm</F> <.></.> may happen to everyone.</B>

<A>O K. <nvs>cough</nvs> Thank you. So, <F>er</F> <.></.> can you compare going somewhere by car and <.></.> by train?</A>

So, <F>umm</F> <.></.> I like <.></.> going somewhere by car. <.></.> But <F>er</F> I think it depends. <.></.> If we <.></.> go to <.></.> downtown or <R>other</R> other areas, we <F>umm</F> should go by train, because there are <.></.> few parking lots <.></.> and <.></.> maybe road must be very crowded. <F>Umm</F>. And train is very punctual in Japan and cheap <.></.> than highway <.></.> fare. So, <.></.> <F>umm</F> I always <SC>took a</SC> take a train to go to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> so <.></.> <SC>I an</SC> <F>uh</F> my husband and I and my parents <F>umm</F> maybe make a <.></.> short trip <.></.> <OL><R>arou</R></OL></B>

<A>Yeah.</A>
