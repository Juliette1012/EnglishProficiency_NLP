<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> especially "King Lear" interested me so <F>um</F> it was at my last <?>thing</?> in high school, so I decided to study English literature in Japan</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>since I was going back to Japan.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> also <F>er</F> at that point my <F>um</F> strongest point was using English, so it came like a natural <OL>answer</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. So after you graduated from high school you came back to Japan?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Which do you like better, Japan or Canada?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <laughter>I'm not sure</laughter> because both of them has good points and both of them have the <SC>bad</SC> negative points.</B>
<A>Can you explain <F>er</F> good point of both places?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> the good point of Canada is it has a very nice <F>um</F> summer weather.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Quite cool. And <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> it has more breathing space than <?>that in Japan</?> because of the width of the country. And the better side of Japan is, of course my mother tongue is Japanese, so I won't have to think that much</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>using the language.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. O K. So in Japan, where are you from?</A>

<B>because he was transferred to <H pn="others3">XXX04</H> about four years ago.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. Do you often visit him?</A>
<B>No. Because <laughter>I entered into</laughter> university</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>er</F> I can only visit him <F>er</F> twice a year.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>

<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>Can you describe what kind of place it is?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> it's quite hot.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Although <R>the</R> <F>um</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> the weather in the morning and the evening is quite pleasant because it's surrounded by mountain.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>er</F> on daytime it is quite hot. And <F>er</F> since <F>er</F> it is one of the <F>ur</F> countrysides in Japan you need a car to <R>go</R> <nvs>cough</nvs> <R>go</R> <F>oh</F> go around.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Do you drive in <H pn="others3">XXX04</H>?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> no. I have a <laughter>driver's license</laughter> but I haven't drove a car for about six years <OL>which is quite dangerous</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Right.</A>

<B>go window shopping</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>or</OL> I <SC?>something</SC?> usually read <OL>in my house</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <F>Hmm</F>. What kind of place do you go to?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> it depends but <F>um</F> usually <F>um</F> around Odaiba or</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>ur</F> Shibuya.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Why do you like Odaiba?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>er</F> because of the huge <laughter>shopping malls</laughter>. It's easy to go around because <R>i</R> <F>ur</F> <R>i</R> <nvs>cough</nvs> it has two huge malls. You could go into either one. And then you can spend a day</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>just going around <OL>and talking</OL>. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. I see. O K.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>All right. So first thing today, please look at this picture.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>And please describe this picture.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Um</F> a lady lives in this room with her dog and cat. The room, it looks quite spacious but somewhat old-fashioned because it has a typewriter. And right beside it has a personal computer. And she seems that she's enjoying herself. And also there is a <.></.> stereo and a phone so it doesn't look like an apartment but it seems that she lives with her family.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And also <F>um</F> <SC>the</SC> her pets seems to <F>er</F> enjoying staying in her <laughter>room</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. And you mentioned you have a dog.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Er</F> do you remember how you got that dog?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> yes.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> he came from one of the breeders at the <H pn="others4">XXX05</H> and he came to our house when I was in junior high school.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Quite small.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>er</F> after a year, he went to Canada with our family. So he stayed there till he was five.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So it seemed that he enjoyed <F>er</F> running around the huge yard. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> So the dog came back with you</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>from Canada to Japan.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Oh</F> <R>wh</R> what's the procedure to bring a dog back from Canada to Japan?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> he had to be in a quarantine for two weeks and it was in the middle of the summer, quite hot. And we were quite worried about his health.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. O K. All right. So what do you think is the advantage of having a dog as your family member?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>well</F> <F>um</F> all of the family would have <F>er</F> something to talk about. And whenever we felt <.></.> like depressed, we could just look at the dog and it would probably go <laughter>away</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>So</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>hm</F> that's the advantage. <SC>Especially <F>um</F> <F>er</F> when</SC> especially in my family, my father lives quite far away and he <SC>seldoms come back</SC> seldom comes back. And me and my brother is both university students so we don't stay around in our house quite a long. So</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>it's very hard to find a common topic to talk about.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. All right. Thank you.</A>
</followup>
</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A>So next, we'll do a role-play.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Please read this card. And when you are ready, I'll begin.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B><laughter>O K</laughter>.</B>
<A>O K? Ready?</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. Good afternoon, ma'am. How may I help you?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> I bought this reservation ticket for the train but <F>um</F> the subway that I took to came here was delayed by an accident</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>and therefore, I was not able to catch the reservated train.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And could you give me an exchange because <R>the</R> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>er</F> the subway company gave us a slip of paper that explains that <SC>the</SC> my lateness or my delay is not by my own fault?</B>
<A>O K. Yeah, we can give you a ticket if it's a regular train. But your train was an express train and is a <R>reser</R> reserved seat. So I'm sorry, we can't give you any exchange or refund.</A>
<B>Really. But it's funny because <F>um</F> <SC>your company</SC> train company is <SC>with same</SC> in the same company with the subway.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And since the same company gave me the slip of the <F>um</F> what is it, the proof of delay,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>isn't it</SC> it's <F>um</F> strange that I cannot get an exchange.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. Yeah. You're right. But it's against our policy. I'm sorry.</A>
<B><R>Then</R> <F>um</F> <F>hm</F> then is it possible to get a refund?</B>
<A><F>Er</F> not usually.</A>
<B>But this is a quite unusual <OL>situation</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>Since the accident could have been prevented, especially it was a suicidal <F>well</F> accident.</B>
<A><F>Ohh</F>.</A>
<B>And if <SC>the</SC> how should I say, the staff</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>of the company</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>looked at the <F>er</F> platform quite <OL>often</OL>,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>you could have prevented it.</B>
<A>Right. But there's nobody else that <F>er</F> claiming that there was an accident.</A>
<B>Really. <OL>Then</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>I'll give you a paper and you could phone the company.</B>
<A>All right. O K. I'll do that.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Can you</OL> wait?</A>
<B>Yes, I will.</B>
<A>O K. All right. Thank you. This is the end of the role-play.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. So did you take trains in Canada?</A>
<B>No. <F>Er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <SC>there was only</SC> especially the <SC>live</SC> area I lived in was <H pn="others5">XXX06</H></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>and there was only one train. And the nearest <F>um</F> strain station was about, what, fifteen-minute <laughter>car drive</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I usually took the bus or my <F>hm</F> father took me to my high school.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. <F>Wow</F>. Interesting. So many high school students in Japan go to high school by train</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><R>wh</R> whereas in Canada or United States, they take a bus or parents drive to the school.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. Which do you think is better?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> it really depends on the <F>um</F> situation because in Canada, <F>er</F> <SC>train was</SC> there was only one train. And compared with that, there was quite a few buses <F>um</F> going around <F>um</F> like Yamanote Line <F>um</F> once every fifteen minutes or once every five minute.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>er</F> it's quite cold <laughter>waiting in snow</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I think, <F>um</F> going around the train might be a bit comfortable because it would be punctual.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. O K. So did you have any bad experience in Canada?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I had to wait for my bus for about twenty minutes in a minus twenty weather.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>I don't know who would claimed that <OL>of a very</OL> nice <laughter>experience</laughter>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. <F>Wow</F>. So how did you try to keep yourself warm?</A>
<B>I just stayed inside. There is a usual small waiting room or waiting box. So I usually stayed inside and just covers myself in my coat.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>O K.</A>
</followup>
</stage3>
<stage4>
<task>
<A>All right. Lastly, O K, there are six pictures from one to six. And please make up a story based on these six pictures.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And</OL> please start your story with "One day last week," because this happened before.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <F>Er</F> one day last week, <F>er</F> Mark was driving his car. And then from the other side, <F>er</F> there was a man driving a motorcycle. And also he was phoning with his girlfriend on the cellphone. And when Mark tried to turn left, the <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>er</F> driver of the motorcycle <F>er</F> <.></.> 's <F>er</F> cellphone somewhat slipped from his hand and it hit Mark's <F>er</F> mirror. And because of that, his cellphone broke. And at the same time, because Mark was surprised by the <F>er</F> sudden appearance of the man, he hit the <F>um</F> bike. <SC>The man claimed to</SC> <F>um</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> excuse me, the man claimed to have his <F>um</F> bike repaired as <F>well</F> as his cellphone repaired. Therefore they had to call the police. And when police arrived, <SC>Marked</SC> Mark explained the situation and also he explained to the policeman that the man was using his cellphone which was prohibited. <nvs>cough</nvs> And therefore <F>um</F> the policeman <F>er</F> did write the paper but it turns out that he does not have to pay for the man's <F>um</F> bike's repair and so his cellphone's repair. So the man had to wait for the <F>um</F> what is it, <F>er</F> the truck to take his bike to a garage. And since he had no other option, he had to pay for his own repairs.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. Thank you.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Em</F> especially in Tokyo, there are many people who have a driver's license but actually don't drive at all</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>like <OL>yourself</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><laughter>Yes</laughter></OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. But <F>er</F> getting driver's license is really expensive.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. What do you think of this situation?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>well</F> to some point, yeah, <F>er</F> it is quite expensive. But <F>er</F> because it is expensive, people do try to concentrate and get their driver's licenses as fast as possible.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I think it is, I think, a necessary evil in <SC>something</SC> some case.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Because <F>um</F> meaning of <R>a</R> a lower price is sometimes a bad quality,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>and especially when one is getting a driver's license, it is quite important to understand the danger of <OL>driving</OL>,</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>so I think it is <F>uh</F> necessary to pay</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>huge amount of money</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>in some way.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. All right. And here in this story, this guy is using a cellular phone <R>which</R> which is illegal.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. There are many people using a <laughter>cellular phone in the train</laughter>. <F>Er</F> <SC>wh</SC> how do you think we can <F>er</F> make them not <R>u</R> use cellular phone in the train?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <F>well</F> <F>um</F> the easiest way is <F>ur</F> make a train that does not receive a cellphone.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Like</OL> in concert halls.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Some of the concert halls do <F>er</F> <SC>build their <F>um</F> concert halls</SC> weld a led</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>inside their wall which does not allow any reception of cellphones <OL>so</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>might be a good idea</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>if you seriously want to</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>stop the <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> passenger using cellphones.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So if you saw a guy talking on the cellphone in a loud voice, what would you do?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I would just watch and see what he does. If he's talking more than five minutes, <F>um</F> I might think about calling the <F>er</F> staff of the train, because</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>it is well-known that if someone <F>um</F> says something to the <F>er</F> <SC>s</SC> person using cellphone, they sometimes <?>get</?> quite violent.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> calling the <F>er</F> staff would be a good thing.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But sometimes people do <SC>s</SC> <F>um</F> use cellphone on the train but usually they will tell <?>those</?> the person at the other end that they're on the train and they'll arrive in about ten, fifteen minutes, I'll just go by and be able to sit down.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>How should I say it? <F>Uh</F> <?>up</?> the phone. So I think it's just fine for about five, ten minutes.</B>
<A><OL><laughter><F>Hm</F></laughter></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>O K.</A>
</followup>
</stage4>
<stage5>
<A>All right. So we have come to almost the end of the interview.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>So do you have any plans after this interview?</A>
<B>No. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>So you're going home?</A>
<B>Yes, I'm going home.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. How long will it take to go to</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>.</B>
<A><R><H pn="others2">XXX03</H></R> <H pn="others2">XXX03</H>? <F>Hm</F>?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> it's actually <F>er</F> <H pn="others6">XXX07</H> on the <OL><H pn="others7">XXX08</H></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL> <OL><F>uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So it's about</OL> maximum, an hour.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. So you'll change the train in <H pn="others8">XXX09</H>?</A>
<B>Yes, <OL>I think</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. Do you have to walk for a long time from <H pn="others6">XXX07</H>?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> walking <nvs>laughter</nvs> would be a quite long <OL>walk</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.</A>
<B>But I usually take the bus.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. Good. <OL><laughter>Because</laughter></OL> it's so windy <laughter>today</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter><??></??> <?>windy</?></laughter></OL>.</B>
