And <??></??> of course <SC>was</SC> <F>er</F> also was <??></??>. And <nvs>sigh</nvs> he was pretty aged, was over fifty. <SC>And</SC> <.></.> but <F>um</F> <SC>he had</SC> <R>he</R> <F>uh</F> <SC>he is</SC> he's very <F>erm</F> <R>li</R> listen to our opinions <R>even</R> <F>uh</F> even <SC>we</SC> <F>err</F> <.></.> the people like us who <R>just</R> just enter the company, very <R>youn</R> <SC>younger</SC> young <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>uum</F> who doesn't know well about the sales persons. <F>Er</F>. <R>Even</R> even like those kind of people's opinion, <??></??> he had a <F>err</F> good ear. I mean, really he did listen to <R>the</R> <F>err</F> the <F>er</F> <F>er</F> younger's opinion. And he usually let us do <R>what</R> whatever we wanted to do, yeah, <F>er</F> <R>on</R> on our way <R>I</R> it's not unlegal things or <OL>so</OL>. <nvs>sniff</nvs></B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL>.</A>
