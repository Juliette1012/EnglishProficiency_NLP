And <..></..> I kept the dog outside, but not in my room. <.></.> <F>Ah</F> it looks this room is better than I used to have.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. O K. <F>Ah</F> you said you had a dog. Can you tell me a story regarding your dog?</A>

<B><CO>So <R>when I</R> <.></.> <F>ah</F> <..></..> when I live</CO>. <F>Ah</F>. <.></.> O K. <F>er</F> <..></..> I think the dog <.></.> thought he is a <.></.> member of our family. And <F>ah</F> I guess the dog thought <.></.> he is <SC>a</SC> <F>ah</F> older and senior than myself. <.></.> So he didn't pay any respect to me. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>

<B><OL><F>Mm-hum</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And</OL>, <F>ah</F> tell me when you are ready.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card for a while.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K?</A>
<B><OL><F>Mm-hum</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. May I help you, sir?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> yes. <R>I</R> <F>ah</F> <.></.> I reserved a <F>ah</F> seat, but <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <F>ah</F> <.></.> I delayed the train. So I want to change this train ticket.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I'm very sorry, sir, but it's against our policy to exchange <.></.> to another ticket.</A>
<B>So, <R>can you</R> <F>ah</F> <..></..> <R>can you</R> <.></.> <SC>ei</SC> <F>ah</F> can you exchange this to a <F>ah</F> money, or <.></.> I want to <SC>ei</SC> <F>ah</F> get another train.</B>
<A>Right. <F>Ah</F> <F>well</F> see, the ticket you have was a fixed ticket.</A>
<B><F>Uhu</F>.</B>
<A>So, unless you have a very good reason, I can't give you any refund or exchange.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Ah</F>. <..></..> So, <F>ah</F> <..></..> can I get normal train? I mean, <F>ah</F> not reserved train, <SC>but also</SC> but <F>ah</F> normal, unreserved train.</B>
<A>Yes. <.></.> But I can't give you refund for the extra amount you paid to reserve.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> <SC>what</SC> why not?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> because it's a fixed ticket, and it's cheaper than a regular price.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F> <F>mm-hum</F>.</B>
<A>So <F>ahm</F> <.></.> it's not a normal fare ticket, so I can't give you any <.></.> refund.</A>
<B>So, if I give you <F>ah</F> <SC>an</SC> some reason, why <R>I</R> <..></..> <F>ah</F> I was late, <R>you</R></B>
<A>Right, <F>ah</F> yeah.</A>
<B>you <F>er</F> refund, or, you know, give me another ticket?</B>
<A>Right. If it's an inevitable situation, then <.></.> <F>ahm</F> I'll consider that.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. <.></.> O K. <F>Ah</F>. <..></..> O K. <R>I</R> <F>ah</F> I came here by taxi, and <F>er</F> there was a traffic jam. And <F>ah</F> <.></.> I guess it's not my fault. And <F>ah</F> <..></..> I think you should pay a refund. Or, <.></.> <F>ah</F> you know, exchange this ticket to another one.</B>
<A>I see. So you left your house early enough?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>O K. There was an accident or something?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> I guess so. I cannot tell exact reason right now, but <F>ah</F> <.></.> there was a heavy traffic jam. It's not normal.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. O K. <F>Well</F>. I'm new here, so, let me <F>ahm</F> ask my boss if I could transfer to the next one. <OL>Is that alright</OL>?</A>
