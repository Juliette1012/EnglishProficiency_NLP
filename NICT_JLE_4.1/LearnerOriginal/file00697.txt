<A>So do you often go shopping in a department store?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. <F>Well</F> actually, very difficult to go to shopping on weekends because <SC>my kids</SC> there is a kid. So this year, <F>er</F> actually <SC>I wen</SC> I go to the university to study. So I have <F>ur</F> a little bit time to <SC>sh</SC> go shopping on weekdays.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>So I stop by the department, and then I buy my clothes and shoes. So not so often.</B>
<A><F>Um</F></A>
<B>Usually not so often. But this year luckily <F>um</F> <F>uum</F> I can go.</B>
<A>So usually when we have a baby.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Er</F> woman take care of him.</A>

<A>Or her. And our free time will be limited.</A>
<B>Yeah. <OL>That's right</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL>. What do you think of that?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>uum</F> <F>well</F> <SC>when I</SC> <R>when</R> <F>ur</F> when the baby is so small, I mean baby means zero and <SC>one year</SC> <SC>the two</SC> one year, <F>um</F> <SC>bre</SC> <SC>and baby</SC> I did breast feeding for the baby so <SC>women and wife</SC> <SC>women is a very important</SC> mother is very important. So <SC>mo</SC> it's <F>er</F> <F>um</F> <F>ur</F> maybe mother stay home, and take care <SC>of</SC> for <R>ba</R> baby, it's a good for the baby. And then I feel it's good. I mean and free time is limited, it's <F>um</F> no problem because baby need mothers. But three, four, five years, <F>ur</F> <SC>more</SC> if my husband more <SC>help me</SC> helps me, I'm very comfortable <F>um</F> to live everyday, I think. But my husband also <SC>has</SC> <F>ur</F> is a teacher. And then weekends he has a club activity's coach. So <SC>very</SC> <R>no</R> <SC>no</SC> he has also no free time. And then I'm so tight schedule. So <F>uum</F> both <SC>of</SC> are very limited free time.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>Because the kids are <SC>small</SC> young. <F>Um</F>. So I think cooperation is very important, <OL>I think</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B>Yeah. Depend on the age <OL>of the kids</OL>.</B>
