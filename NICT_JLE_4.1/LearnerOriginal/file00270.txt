</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A>Now, <SC>I'm going to do a <SC>p</SC> role</SC> <F>eh</F> let's do a role play.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>Please read this card.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>O K? And when you are ready, let's begin.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B><F>Mm</F> <F>hm</F>.</B>
<A>Are you ready?</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is still reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>All right. So I'm <SC>the tour</SC> <F>um</F> travel agent. How can I help you, sir?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yeah. <F>Ah</F> I joined one <F>er</F> travel tour to Las Vegas</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and <SC>I</SC> <F>er</F> of course, <F>er</F> <R>you</R> <R>you</R> <F>mm</F> <SC>you said</SC> <F>er</F> you advertised</B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B><OL>this tour was</OL> very nice.</B>
<A><OL>That's right</OL>. Yes, it's <OL>a very popular package</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And <SC>very <R>lux</R> luxury</SC></OL> <F>eh</F> <F>mm</F> <F>er</F> <?>a lot of</?> very luxury feeling I can enjoy.</B>
<A>That's right.</A>
<B>Yeah. But <F>eh</F> unfortunately, we have some <F>mm</F> problem. Actually, three problems. One is <F>eh</F> <SC>meat</SC> quality of meat or so. So first day, it's not so bad, but second day, <SC>it was</SC> <SC>it's</SC> <R>I</R> I was very surprised. <SC>It was</SC> <SC>it seemed it was</SC> <F>eh</F> it seemed a kind of vegetable day <laughter>or so</laughter>. So, small meat, <R?>wh</R?> <?>what</?> probably chicken meat or so I can, but <R>I went</R> <F>eh</F> we went to U S A, so I expected <F>er</F> to eat or so, other such kind of very expensive meat,</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I expected</OL> but unfortunately, I didn't enjoy one day. And so next day, <F>well</F> <R>so <F>uh</F> I</R> you know, so I didn't enjoy any beef or so.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Eh</F> chicken is <SC>expensive</SC> <F>eh</F> more expensive than the beef? I don't think <laughter>so</laughter>, even if in U S A.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And second point is room. Of course, room size itself <SC>not</SC> no problem. But how to say, <SC>how</SC> room <R>keep</R> keeper or condition <F>er</F> it was not so good. For example, <F>eh</F> I couldn't get hot water. <F>Er</F> <R>p</R> probably <R>withi</R> within one liter or so <F>eh</F> when I opened the <F>er</F> it starts <F>er</F> <F>oh</F> I forgot the exact <??></??> <SC>exact</SC> when <SC>we</SC> I try to have <SC>wa</SC> hot water or so in the bath or so, nothing, so shower, I have to wait five minutes, ten minutes. <F>Oh</F>. But finally, a little bit warm. Of course, Las Vegas itself <SC>not so warm</SC> <F>eh</F> not so cold</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>but <F>oh</F> I like to have hot water, <OL>close</OL> to forty centigrade but I didn't.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. May I ask what the third problem is?</A>
<B>Third one? <F>Oh</F>. Third one. Very <R>I</R> I expect very, how to say, luxury tour, <R>so <F>uu</F> our</R> how to say, <R>our</R> <F>eh</F> our <F>mm</F> group member should be, how to say, very <??></??> very high society or luxury people I expected. Actually, <F>eh</F> <R>it's</R> <SC>it's</SC> <F>eh</F> I suppose it was <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> group or so.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I was very</OL> surprised. <F>Erm</F> so I went to Las Vegas with them, then, <R>its</R> its looks like, how say, discount tour, economic tour or so.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><SC>I</SC> so</OL>, I didn't expect such kind of thing.</B>
<A>I'm really <OL>sorry about your problem</OL>, sir.</A>
<B><OL><??></??></OL> Yeah.</B>
<A>But first of all, <F>em</F> <F>well</F> the first and second complaint, <F>um</F> we hope that you would have discussed that to our local tour guide in Las Vegas.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>Did you tell them?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>.</B>
<A>Did you tell our local guide?</A>
<B>Frankly <laughter>speaking</laughter>, not yet. But <R>I</R> <SC>I mentioned such kind of</SC> <F>eh</F> I expressed such kind of <F>eh</F> argument to <F>uh</F> the tour conductor or so. I forgot <F>ur</F> his name or so, actually. <F>Uh</F> probably <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H> <JP>san</JP>? <F>Oh</F> sorry. <F>Er</F> excuse me. <F>Er</F> probably she. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> I see. <F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> <OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F> <R>any</R></OL> anyway, so I didn't <??></??> mention such kind of thing to local <??></??> staff or so.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>. O K. <F>Uhh</F> the third problem about other people who joined the tour, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do <SC>that</SC> about that, sir. <OL><CO>A lot of people</CO></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><CO>But</CO></OL>. <F>Eh</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Because <F>eh</F> it's a luxurious tour we offer at such a reasonable price, <F>um</F> <SC>many customers</SC> many <F>um</F> people join the tour. That's why it's so popular. I'm afraid that <SC>you couldn't enjoy</SC> you couldn't get along well with them as much,</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>um</F> but I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that, sir.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> but I don't think <F>er</F> <R>they</R> they were charged as same <F>uh</F> cost as myself.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I'm sure they were.</A>
<B>But <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>oh</F> <SC>my</SC> of course, you can say so, but I was very surprised. <SC>So anyway</SC> so, that kind of <OL>group</OL>,</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B>only <R>our</R> <SC>our</SC> myself and my wife <F>eh</F> is another kind group or so.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Wow</F>. "What happened?". My wife complained to me, actually, yeah.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. Yeah.</B>
<A>O K, then, let me talk to the manager. <OL>O K</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>, please. Yeah.</B>

<A><F>Ah</F>. How do you deal with it?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <F>mm</F> anyway, so, at first, <F>eh</F> I try to hear or listen to his comment or so, and also, what happened or so. Then, <F>eh</F> probably <F>er</F> <R>I can</R> I can guess, "<F>oh</F> <SC>how should</SC> <F>eh</F> how <SC>can</SC> I <R>can</R> can solve the problem or <F>uh</F> this argument?".</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F> I see.</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Oh</F> and of course, sometimes, <nvs>laughter</nvs> it's very difficult <SC>because of</SC> because we didn't do any mistake or so. Sometimes <SC>their mis</SC> based on their mistake or their colleague's mistake, they got mad.</B>
<A><?>Right</?>.</A>
