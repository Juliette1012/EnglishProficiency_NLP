<A><F>Wow</F>. How do you like having a pastor father?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I don't know. He's very <F>urm</F> <nvs>smack</nvs> conservative.</B>

And <F>hm</F> I don't know. <F>Ur</F> her birthday is <F>ur</F> <SC>November the</SC> <F>ur</F> wait, October the thirtieth. And my birthday is November the first. So we usually have <F>ur</F> one big birthday together <OL><??></??></OL>.</B>

<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And so what's it, <F>urm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>he spent his <F>ur</F> i</SC> his mother was a widow ever since he was born. So <F>urm</F> <SC?>was</SC?> the family <SC>the</SC> <R>they</R> they were very poor. So <F>ur</F> <R>he</R> he wanted to be a piano player since he was like <nvs>sniff</nvs> maybe twelve. And so he finally got his first piano at like age twenty-one. And <F>oh</F> right after that, he went to France in order to study piano.

<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>Like he found like a limit to his extent of like knowledge and skill in piano.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
