<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A>you didn't <SC>in</SC> <OL>enter in April</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Because</OL> I finished <F>urm</F> middle school <R>in</R> in the States.</B>

<B>And then yeah, after I finished schools there, I came back here.</B>

<A>And you picked up your English there?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. What kind of difficulties did you have in the beginning when you <OL>first</OL> went there?</A>
<B><OL><F>Well</F></OL> at first, I couldn't speak English <SC>so</SC> but I entered a private school</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>there. That was <F>urm</F> my dad's idea. But there were no Japanese <F>uh</F> <F>urm</F> so <R>I</R> <F>ur</F> I learned English <R>from</R> <F>ur</F> from, I don't know, speaking with my friends. <SC>I didn't really</SC> I wasn't really taught by</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>teachers.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>The grammars</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>and stuff. But I learned by listening and speaking.</B>
<A>I see. O K.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A><F>Urm</F> first thing today, I want you to <F>er</F> describe a picture. Sorry, <??></??> pick the right one. There it is. Please describe this picture. <nvs>cough</nvs></A>
<B><F>Urm</F> this is probably in high school. The teacher's teaching <SC>math</SC> mathematic to students, but none of the students <SC>listens</SC> listen to the teacher. <.></.> <F>Urm</F> <F>oh</F> but a boy in blond hair and a girl with brown hair is listening to the teacher. <F>Urm</F> shall I describe all the other <OL>students</OL>?</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> O K</OL>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Urm</F> then can you compare that class to <R>your class</R> your class in <F>urm</F> the States, your middle school?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> back in the States.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <.></.> <F>well</F> back in the States, <F>urm</F> <F>well</F> most of the students listened to the teachers.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>Not like the people in the picture.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>Because <R>we</R> we were not allowed to drink or <R>chew</R> chew gum</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>or talk with other students in the classroom.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see. what do you think of that kind of strict environment?</A>
<B>I think <R>it's</R> it's a really good idea.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>Because <SC>if there were no any</SC> if there weren't any strict restrictions,</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>urm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>the teachers</SC> <F>uh</F> <F>well</F> I feel bad for the teachers. And also it's no good for the students because the school is a place for learning, I think. <OL>That's my opinion</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F> <F>mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>But yeah. Yes. <nvs>cough</nvs></B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>So.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> what do you find different from your class <OL>now</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>in</OL> Japan?</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. In Japan.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC>Japanese</SC> I think Japanese schools are more strict than <F>ur</F> in America because we hardly ever hear other students talk in class. It's really quiet all the time. And I think the <R>Jap</R> <F>ur</F> Japanese teachers point to the students. If we were doing math, they would point to the students <SC>and</SC> <F>ur</F> to do the problems. And I don't know, <SC>it's</SC> Japanese students <SC>particimate</SC> participate more in a class.</B>

<A><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> why don't you like them?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> at first, <F>urm</F> <R>I didn't</R> I didn't try <SC>this</SC> these on, and I bought it.</B>

<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>of the gloves. So I'm hoping to refund.</B>
<A>I see. But from what I hear, isn't it that your responsibility to check the <OL>size</OL> before buying it?</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Yes. Yes. But <F>urm</F> if I can, <R>I</R> I want to refund.</B>

</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. That's the end of the role-play. <F>Urm</F></A>
<B>Yeah.</B>

<B>Yes, <OL>many</OL> times.</B>
<A><OL><F>Well</F></OL> <R>can y</R> <OL>can you</OL></A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A>tell me one of the experience you had?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> it happen all the time in America.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mm-hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><SC>I</SC></OL> because refund is a common thing</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>in American than in Japan.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I don't know, like, <SC>if I buy</SC> <F>well</F> I bought jeans. But the length of the jeans didn't fit my legs so I refund it. But it was no problem.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>well</F> when I came to Japan, I <R>wen</R> went to <F>ur</F> refund something I forget, but <SC>they wouldn't</SC> <F>ur</F> they didn't let me refund.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> <OL>I was surprised</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. <CO>Why do you</CO>? Right. Why do you think <F>urm</F> <F>er</F> shops in Japan often refuse to refund?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. <.></.> I don't know. I'm not sure, but I think it's because <F>urm</F> if you refund, <F>urm</F> most of the time, it's like ripped or it's damaged and some kinds. So <F>ur</F> <R>they don't</R> they don't want the damaged stuff back.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>And I think it's the <F>ur</F> consumer's responsibility.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>So</SC> but I don't know why Americans will let buyers refund.</B>
<A>Right. <OL><laughter>O K</laughter> <nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>.</A>
