<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Do you like winter?</A>
<B>I like winter. But <SC>I actually</SC> I rather like <R>to</R> <F>er</F> to be in warm place in winter. So I love to go to Bali Island.</B>
<A>Bali?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. What kind of place is it?</A>
<B><F>Ar</F>. Don't you know Bali? But,</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>Bali is actually in Indonesia. And <R>it's</R> <F>er</F> how can I say that, it's totally different culture from Japan. And the Balinese people actually believes the God. But their religion is <F>er</F> different from Japanese one. <SC>And</SC> <SC>so</SC> and actually that they really love to be in very quiet <.></.> state of mind. So I can really relax in Bali Island. And actually the weather is wonderful. <R>It's</R> <SC>it's a kind of</SC> always like summer kind of weather.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So it's very warm,</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and <?>relaxing</?>.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And actually <SC>the flower is</SC> <F>er</F> always that there are a lot of flowers in Bali Island. So the smell is really nice. So I love to be in Bali.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. I see.</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>.</B>
<A>Then, what do you do when you are in Bali?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. Just relax. <F>Erm</F> <SC>reading</SC> just read books. Or reading books <R>and</R> <.></.> and just go to the beach and sleep and have nice time. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL><??></??></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Is it</OL> safe?</A>
<B>It's really safe. So you don't to need be <SC>worried about</SC> <R>to</R> too much worry about <F>er</F> your safety.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>Because the</SC> <F>erm</F> but maybe just I don't have <SC>knowledge</SC> enough knowledge. But <SC>I feel like</SC> <R>I</R> I feel safe in Bali. So I haven't heard any kind of <SC>trouble</SC> serious trouble in Bali.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I think <R>that's</R> that's fine. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. That's good, good. <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Thank you</OL>.</B>
<A>All right. <F>Er</F>. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>,</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>do you have any hobbies?</A>
<B>My hobbies. <F>Er</F>. Maybe it's a same thing. And duplicated <laughter>story, but</laughter> I like reading books. <SC>And I like</SC> and also I love listening music. And <R>because</R> because <SC>my</SC> I work a little bit busy in weekdays. So in the weekend, <SC>my hobby is</SC> mainly the purpose of my hobby is to relax. And be myself,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and have my own time. <F>Mmm</F>. <CO><OL>So</OL></CO>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. What kind of books do you like?</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>. I like <SC>Miya</SC> <F>er</F> Miyuki Miyabe. She is <F>er</F> novelist in Japan. And she is very famous. She won several awards. <F>Er</F> and <SC>her</SC> the reason why I like her book is because that <R>she can</R> <F>mmm</F> <SC>she can ex</SC> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> <SC>exple</SC> <F>ah</F> she can express her character and her personality into the characters in her books.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>mmm</F> I can feel her personality through her books. So I like reading her books. And also at the same time, <F>er</F> <R>she is very <.></.> good at</R> <F>mmm</F> <?>how can I say</?> she is very good at <F>er</F> creating the story. <SC>Sto</SC> <SC>not</SC> <F>mmm</F> <SC>it's</SC> <R>it sounds very</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> it sounds <laughter>very</laughter> average, but <F>er</F> usually that good story telling is very difficult. Because <R>it is so dif</R> <F>mmm</F> it is so difficult to creating the character in the story.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I think that, <SC>both of</SC> because of both reasons that I love to read her books.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. I see.</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>.</B>
<A>And <OL>what kind of</OL> person,</A>
<B><OL><nvs>sniff</nvs></OL></B>
<A>is she?</A>
<B>I don't know.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> But <SC>I can feel her peronali</SC> <F>uh</F> I assume that <SC>she should</SC> <F>mmm</F> she must be very warm and kind and also at the same time, she is very clever. Because she can develop her story by herself.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <SC>be</SC> I think that creation is very <F>mmm</F> wonderful thing to see. If you don't have imagination that you cannot develop and create story. And of course, you cannot entertain people who read your books. So I think that she has a great power to entertain people. And at the same time, that she is very good at expressing herself into her books.</B>
<A><F>Umm</F>. Sounds interesting.</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. I like to read her book, too.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. So, now please tell me <OL>about</OL> this picture.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. Yes. <JP><F>Eh</F></JP>. Just tell this picture?</B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. <SC>There are a couple in a</SC> I think it's <F>er</F> in a French restaurant or <laughter>something</laughter>. Because I can see a lot of wine <R>in</R> in this picture. And a couple wears a very formal dresses. So I think that it's a kind of little bit expensive place <R>to be</R> to be in here. And <F>er</F> <SC>there are so</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>and also that</SC> <F>er</F> there is a woman who is playing the piano in this picture. So, I assume that they have to pay a lot of money to be in here and enjoy wine. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>And one person</SC> and I think, yeah <?></?> <SC>i</SC> <F>er</F> <R>one person is recommending</R> <F>mm</F> one person is recommending the special wine, I think. Must be expensive, <laughter>too</laughter>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And he wears a formal wear, too. And his dress <F>er</F> is <F>er</F> <SC>black</SC> mainly black, very formal dress. And he has a white tie. And he is smiling. Because this wine must be very expensive. So I assume that he is recommending strongly to drink this wine to him. <F>Er</F> but actually that <SC>he</SC> <R>the</R> <SC>the ca</SC> the man <.></.> <SC>s</SC> yeah <F>er</F> is sitting at the table is drinking a wine already. So maybe <F>mm</F> it's my mistake that actually that he already orders this wine <R>from</R> from the person in a restaurant. And he <SC>also smi</SC> is also smiling. So, maybe he is <.></.> saying his comments to this wine. Cause <SC>he is testing</SC> <SC>he is</SC> I assume that he already tested the taste of this wine. And the girl next to him is also that the smiling. But maybe because she is nervous to be in such kind of expensive place. <SC>And actually, the</SC> and I can see the watch. And <.></.> the time is seven o'clock. And it must be at night. So in the night, the couple, maybe they are not so familiar to each other. Because that if <SC>they are</SC> <SC><laughter>they already</laughter> had</SC> they already develop the strong relationship each other, that <SC>they don't ma</SC> maybe they don't need to be in this kind of formal expensive restaurant. So I think that they are <F>er</F> very in a beginning of their relationship. Or maybe this is the very <F>er</F> memorable day for them.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F> <OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>. <CO>So</CO>.</B>

<A>of incident?</A>
<B><F>Em</F>. <F>Ah</F> many times. Because <nvs>laughter</nvs> I'm a troublemaker. <laughter>So</laughter> usually <SC>I</SC> it's very easy for me <R>to</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> to be lost in a totally <F>er</F> unknown places,</B>

<A><F>Hm</F> this time,</A>
<B><OL><SC><JP>Hai</JP></SC></OL></B>
<A><OL>Please</OL></A>
<B><OL><F>uh</F> yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>make</OL> a short story,</A>
<B><F>A-ha</F>.</B>
<A>using these six pictures.</A>
<B><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>But this happened before.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>So please make a story with "One day last week".</A>
<B>One day last week. O K. <CO><R>I</R> <R>is this</R> is this me or,</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. <OL>You can</OL></A>
<B>she is sort of different</CO>.</B>
<A>name her <OL>Hanako</OL></A>
<B><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>or you</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Ah</F></OL> O K. <F>Hmm</F>. So <R>she is</R> <F>er</F> she is Hanako.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And Hanako went to a department <R>one day last week</R> one day last week. <F>Er</F> and <R>she</R> she bought a necktie for his father <..></..> in the department store. And then, she <F>er</F> <SC>in the de</SC> <F>mm</F> <R>it's</R> it's very short story. <R>I</R> is that O K? <F>Ah</F> O K.</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> <R>she</R> she bought it for him as a present for <R>his</R> <F>er</F> his birthday. <R>And</R> and then that <F>er</F> Hanako <R>found</R> found out that <F>er</F> there was a <SC>sale</SC> final sale in the department store <SC>for shoes</SC> for her shoes. And the discount level is thirty percent. So it was very attractive for her. But <R>I don't</R> I don't get that whether she bought her shoes or not from this picture. So I don't know what she did. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter><R>And</R></laughter> and then, the fortunately for her that the there was another sale for <SC>shirt for</SC> no, no, <SC>just dresses</SC> no, not dress, just <R>casual</R> casual suits. And the discount level was fifty percent off. <SC>And she</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>I</SC> and also at the <R>s</R> <F>mmm</F> same thing that <SC>I don't know</SC> I don't get whether she bought the <SC>shirt</SC> yellow shirt or not from this picture. But I assume that she was very happy to find out the thirty percent discount and fifty percent discount at the same day. So maybe it's a season of their sale for this department store. <F>Er</F> <F>ah</F> <SC>but actually, that the she</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> but <R>I</R> <SC>I finally</SC> I get it from the number six picture that she bought a lot of things. Because that when <.></.> she <F>er</F> went into the department store, she had only one bag. But actually that <R>when</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> when she went out from the department store that she had <R>four</R> four bags <SC>for this department</SC> of this department with the necktie. So I can easily say that she bought a lot of things, maybe shoes, maybe shirt, maybe <nvs>laughter</nvs> skirt. I don't know. <CO>But</CO>.</B>
