<A>O K. Good. So <R>whi</R> <F>er</F> which do you think is better, Japanese room or Western style Room?</A>
<B><R>I</R> I prefer Japanese style room because you can lie down on the floor and if you sit on the floor, the room looks bigger than <R>sitting on the</R> sitting on the chair, and my room is not enough to put the big desk and big chairs, so. And <SC>you</SC> if you have a floorings room, you have to <F>ah</F> <SC>clean up</SC> clean the floor every day because <?>that is pretty</?> dusty <OL><laughter>I think</laughter></OL>.</B>

<B>You know, I think it's good one but you know <??></??> ten thousand yen things are sometimes, very <F>er</F> <SC>not</SC> doesn't have a good quality, so <SC>I'm</SC> maybe I'm greedy but <SC>I want some more</SC> I want <.></.> good quality one but <F>ah</F> price's not expansive.

<B><OL>the cage</OL>.</B>
<A>Right. What do you think about that?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> It's very <.></.> a kind of <R>pi</R> pity <F>ah</F> very sad thing, I think, and sometimes the <SC>ca</SC> inside the cage are dirty and pretty small, so I don't like that, to see that situation, and that's not good for the animal, but <F>mm</F> yeah, I saw some <SC>goo</SC> <F>ah</F> very clean and good zoo in abroad so there is no cage, but between the guest and animals there is a deep edge, deep cave. <?>How do you say</?>? <R>So</R> so animal can't escape and we can see the animal <F>er</F> without cage.
