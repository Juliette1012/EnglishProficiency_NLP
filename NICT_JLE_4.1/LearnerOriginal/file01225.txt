<B>We had small classes. So like, each child got <F>um</F> the maximum attention that she could get from the teacher</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>

<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>in our school. And <F>um</F> <F>well</F> we weren't allowed to talk in class. So we were not allowed to drink or play with our mobile phones. We weren't allowed to carry mobile phones into our school. So and the desks were arranged in a more semi-circular way, so <SC>we were</SC> like we were surrounding the teacher.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. That's basically the differences.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. O K. Thank you very much. Did you have any troubles or hard time for you to cope with <F>er</F> English people?</A>

<A>Really?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>So everybody was, you know, typical white people. So they have some, you know, prejudice or something. <SC>They</SC> it was hard for some of them to accept me and it was hard for me to accept them. So like they sometimes called me Chinese and they started making faces. So that I was very hurt like that. But then, you know, we grew up together, so <SC>it wasn't</SC> <F>um</F> at first, those kind of things happen. But then like we got used to each other being different.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
