<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>uh</F> <F>ur</F> G theory.

But <F>ur</F> there is no speaking section <SC>in the</SC> into the entrance examination. So <F>uh</F> there is a big gap between the class content and <F>ur</F> the purpose of the guidelines. Of course S S T one of the speaking test, but <F>uh</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> I believe the <F>uh</F> S S T is proficiency test. But <F>uh</F> <SC>my pur</SC> my interest goes to the achievement test.</B>
