</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A><F>Well</F> today, I'm going to show you a picture.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewer is looking for a picture.</ctxt>
<A>O K. So, please describe this picture for me.</A>
<B>So <F>er</F> this is a not usual <F>er</F> school because <F>er</F> <F>urr</F> there are many kind of <F>err</F> people. Young girl <R>and</R> <F>ur</F> and also the middle aged. <F>Err</F> man and woman. <SC>So</SC> and also, it is school <SC>something</SC> <F>er</F> <F>ur</F> or something like <F>err</F> culture or life-long education. So I think <SC>this teacher <F>er</F> is not so</SC> <F>err</F> it's very difficult for teacher <R>to</R> <F>ur</F> to control the classroom because <F>ur</F> <SC?>mister</SC?> middle-aged person cannot follow the study. And <F>ur</F> some ladies is chatting each other. So <.></.> <SC>the</SC> on the board, some <F>ur</F> <R>mathematics</R> mathematics. Very <F>ur</F> difficult to know clearly what kind of school.</B>
<A>I see. <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>Maybe</R></OL> maybe <F>ur</F> some culture school.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Well</F> so, <SC>what do you think or</SC> what do you think this teacher should do to improve this</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F>.</B>
<A>atmosphere or these students' attitude?</A>
<B>Yeah. So she has to ask <F>ur</F> students to follow the rules. <JP><F>Ee</F></JP>. As a student, otherwise <.></.> she can ask them to go out classroom. Otherwise <F>er</F> <F>er</F> near good students can not study, so she has to severe for the rules. And <F>er</F> sometimes, she has to prepare some discipline</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>to that <F>ur</F> troublesome students.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see. <F>Well</F> I don't know whether you remember or not your school days. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Yes. Still I remember.</B>
<A><OL>O K, so, <nvs>cough</nvs></OL> what are the big differences between the present school situation,</A>
<B><F>Ummm</F>.</B>
<A>and the schools in your time?</A>
<B>Yeah. <SC>I</SC> I'm not sure <R>the</R> the present situation. <F>Err</F>. But <F>ur</F> sometimes, I <JP><F>ee</F></JP> heard any kind of troubles. So <F>err</F> I think <.></.> this is quite different because <F>ur</F> in my school days, <F>ur</F> we have to follow the rules. And <F>ur</F> we <F>ur</F> respect the teacher. <F>Err</F>. I used to be scolded by teacher. But <F>ur</F> this also, <?>another words</?> <F>err</F> good experience for me. But, nowadays, school <F>er</F> is in a chaos. Some boy <R>cannot sit</R></B>
<A><F>Umm</F>.</A>
<B>cannot sit in the <F>ur</F> studies. And also, some are <??></??> all the students.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Even some violence <??></??> the class room. So, <.></.> <laughter>this my opinion</laughter> <F>err</F>. <.></.> Ministry of Education have to proceed <SC>the</SC> <.></.> how to <F>er</F> improve the school education for the many kinds of person from many fields <OL>advise</OL>.</B>
