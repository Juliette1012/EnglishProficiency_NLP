<A>O K. <OL>All right</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Right</OL>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Then why do you think some students are not concentrating on the lecture?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I think <F>ur</F> <SC>tea</SC> <F>ur</F> in the class, <F>ur</F> it is <F>ur</F> mathematic class. And you know, some students is not interested in mathematics. And <nvs>laughter</nvs> yeah, that's why.</B>

<A><F>Mhm</F> So it's O K for you?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC>it depends on the <F>mm</F> pers</SC> <F>mm</F> it depends on the people. So you know, <R>this</R> this guy is very concentrate on <F>er</F> the class. But <F>well</F> university is very optional so <F>mm</F> <SC>if</SC> <F>er</F> <R>we can</R> <SC>we can</SC> how can I say, <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>well</F> <R>it's</R> it's not good <F>mm</F> view, but it depends on the people. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. Then if you were the teacher,</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>what would you do?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> maybe I will shout, <laughter>and</laughter> say, "Shut up.". <F>Urr</F>.
