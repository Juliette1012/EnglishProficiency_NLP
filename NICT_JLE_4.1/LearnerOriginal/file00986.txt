So <nvs>laughter</nvs> terrible. <laughter>So</laughter> I need a time to sleep and relax in the weekend. So <SC>just <F>er</F> very small</SC> just doing small things, reading books or something. And also, I have to do the some house <F>uu</F> hold things, laundry, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>cleaning</laughter>. Because I am a <laughter>housewife</laughter>.</B>

<B><F>Ah</F>. That's my <OL><laughter>concern</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>I want to try but no time. And also <F>er</F> if I have time <F>er</F> after the work or <R>in</R> in the weekend, I prefer just being relax. <laughter>So it's terrible</laughter>.</B>
<A>Yeah. Yeah. But <R>woul</R> would you tell me about your husband?</A>

<B><OL><F>Mmm</F></OL>. <F>Ah</F>. He was an employee <F>er</F> three years ago. But he is trying to do something by himself. <F>Er</F>. And now, he is trying to <SC>do</SC> <F>mm</F> run a restaurant or <F>er</F> to work for a estate or something. So he is trying <SC>doing</SC> do <laughter><R>anything</R></laughter></B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>anything</SC> any business <F>er</F> <R>to</R> to build up <SC>his own business</SC> his own company.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>So</SC> <F>er</F> and he is <R>very</R> <F>mm</F> very kind and warm person. And very <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> relaxing person, <OL>I</OL> think.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. I'm a little bit sensitive. And I sometimes <F>er</F> give him <F>er</F> some irritating <OL><laughter>feeling</laughter></OL>.</B>

And he enjoyed the work <F>er</F> very much for three years. But that became some routine work. So <SC>he tired</SC> he was tired of the <SC>work</SC> <SC>working</SC> routine work. So he wanted to try something. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. I see. I understand. O K. Thank you very much.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>Now, I'm going to show you a picture.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>Let's see. This one. Would you describe it to me?</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>. <R>It is</R> it is a <laughter><R>school</R></laughter> school class. And <F>er</F> <F>er</F> the students are taking a mathematics class. And the teacher is a woman. <F>Er</F>. <R>She is</R> she is explaining <SC>some graph and the</SC> <R>some</R> some graph to students. And <R>only one</R> only one student are listening to her class very hard. But the others <R>are</R> are doing <F>er</F> anything they want to do. And <R>some</R> some of them are <F>ah</F> <R?>two</R?> two girl <F>er</F> beside the window are talking together. And <F>erm</F> <F>er</F> a girl <R>in the</R> in the first line is, maybe making a mail to her friend. And one person is drinking beverage and listening to some music. <F>Mm</F>. So <R>it's</R> <F>mmm</F> <SC>it's</SC> I don't think it's a very usual atmosphere at <R>Ja</R> <laughter>Japanese high school</laughter>.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><SC>It's not</SC> <F>er</F> it is not the same as I took in <F>er</F> high school <laughter>days</laughter>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Er</F> really? So can you compare the atmosphere,</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>. <OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>with</OL> yours?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. Yes. <F>Er</F>. My high school was <F>er</F> a kind of, <F>mmm</F> how can I express it, <nvs>laughter</nvs> very <F>er</F> high class. <F>Er</F>. <R>The</R> <SC>the students in my <SC>high school</SC> <F>mmm</F> high scho</SC> all of students in my high school <F>er</F> <R>aim</R> aimed to go university. So <SC>we had to</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <??></??> we had to study very hard <R>for</R> for entering university. So the classes are distinguished <R>by</R> by <SC>levels</SC> study levels. <F>Er</F>. So the classes <SC>are very</SC> were <R>very</R> <F>mmm</F> very <F>mmm</F> <.></.> strict atmosphere and a kind of strange, <OL><laughter><R>I think</R></laughter></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><laughter>I think now</laughter>. It was not strange <SC>in my</SC> when I was in high school. But <nvs>laughter</nvs> yeah. Yes, remembering it, it's a little bit strange. Everybody in the classroom <SC>was</SC> <R>wa</R> was studying so hard. Very quiet.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Then what do you think? Why does it happen in this classroom?</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>. <R>Bec</R> <F>mm</F> because <.></.> these people and the class <.></.> are not interested in mathematics. And mathematics is not <F>erm</F> necessary for their life, they think.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>.</A>
<B>So. <R>They are very</R> <F>er</F> <SC>they are very</SC> <R>they</R> they are <F>mmm</F> enjoying their time by themselves. And <SC>I think they are</SC> <..></..> I think <SC>now</SC> that time now <R>is</R> <F>er</F> is only <R>interes</R> interesting thing for them. Not for the future or <SC>not</SC> so they don't have some future plan or future <F>er</F> vision now. <F>Mmm</F>.</B>
<A>I guess you are right. O K. Thank you very much.</A>
