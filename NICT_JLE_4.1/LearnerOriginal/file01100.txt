<B>Now I'm living in <H pn="others1">XXX04</H>. And even on Sunday, I don't see so many people on the street because everyone went out to the big cities like <H pn="others2">XXX05</H> or <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>.

So I used to play outside, and also with my dog. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Mm</F> so my home town is very similar to this picture, like the situation of this picture, I think.

He didn't go straight so <SC>I was</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>I</R> I think <SC>I was</SC> <F>uh</F> <SC>it</SC> I cared about him, <SC>but I couldn't</SC> <F>urr</F> but we attacked <R>each other</R> each other. And then his mobile phone was broken. And he told me I need to fix it, and <SC>pay</SC> I have to pay some money for this mobile phone. And then <F>mhm</F> I couldn't understand it. So I call the policeman, and <F>uum</F> I explained him about the situation <SC>why we attacked</SC> why we got a accident.

<B>Women?</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> women.</A>
<B>Especially?</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>. Because <SC>they're very lonely</SC> they feel lonely, I think. <F>Mm</F> especially in <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> area, there're a lot of people living here, but <F>mm</F> each person's feeling is not satisfied about our lives. <SC>So</SC> and each of them have some feelings <SC>because</SC> <F>uh</F> some feelings that <F>ur</F> <SC>they are alone</SC> they are living alone.
