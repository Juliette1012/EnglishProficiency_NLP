<B><F>Erm</F> I don't have any special plan. But I'm <F>erm</F> living <F>er</F> by myself now so I'm going to see my father who is living in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. And <SC>he</SC> my parents are from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> so <F>er</F> actually <R>I</R> <.></.> I lived in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> until five years ago, but <F>er</F> now I'm living in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> but <R>so</R> so <F>erm</F> <.></.> I going to see my parents in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> and <SC>ha</SC> spend <F>er</F> <F>er</F> New Year <F>er</F> together with my <F>er</F> parents.</B>
<A><F>Umm</F>. That's good. O K. Can you tell me a little bit about <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B><H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. As you know, <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is, <F>er</F> <F>er</F> you know, <R>that</R> that very famous for <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> as a <R><H pn="others2">XXX04</H></R> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. And <F>er</F> <F>er</F> now <SC>it's</SC> that population is about <F>erm</F> I think <F>erm</F> a million, and then <F>erm</F> city <R>is</R> <.></.> <SC>is like almost</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <SC>is like a</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> it's very <F>erm</F> similar to <R>Chiba</R> Chiba Prefecture like a big city. And then <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> I think weather is a little bit colder than Tokyo because <R>they</R> they have a lot of snow in wintertime. Especially when I go to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> every year <SC>at the</SC> <F>er</F> from the end of the year to the beginning of the year, <F>er</F> they <R>alwa</R> always have <F>er</F> snow around New Year's Day, and then <F>erm</F> <.></.> also <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> has <F>er</F> <F>er</F> a lot of mountains, and <F>er</F> <F>er</F> they don't have <F>er</F> much plain area so they have a lot of mountains. And <F>er</F> also surrounded by sea, and there're a lot of islands <F>er</F> in the <H pn="others4">XXX05</H> so <F>er</F> <F>er</F> the view from my house is very good because my house is in the middle of the mountain, and then I can just see <F>er</F> <F>er</F> the cities and also <F>er</F> islands in <H pn="others4">XXX05</H>. And also sometimes I can see <F>erm</F> <H pn="others5">XXX06</H> Prefecture <F>erm</F> <.></.> when <R>the</R> the weather is good, and the air is very clear.</B>
<A>I <OL>see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> it's very very beautiful <OL>city</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Umm</F></OL>. Sounds nice, <OL>isn't it</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>. Yes.</B>
<A>O K. How are you going to spend the time with your parents back in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. Yeah. <R>I</R> I <R>just</R> <R>just</R> just be together. I mean we don't do anything special. Maybe we just go out for shrine for New Year's Day. And then we just stay home and then watch T V together, and then <F>erm</F> <F>erm</F> we cook together. And then <F>erm</F> <.></.> <SC>the</SC> also <F>er</F> <SC>the</SC> in Hiroshima that the fish is very fresh and very <F>erm</F> good quality so <F>er</F> we cook together, and then <F>er</F> <SC>she</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> some of relatives visit us. So we <R>just</R> just spend time together.</B>

<A><.></.> O K. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, will you describe this picture for me?</A>
<B>O K. <F>Erm</F>. It seems to be <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> <.></.> a mountain, and <F>er</F> <.></.> <SC>there're a lot of</SC> <F>er</F> there are <R>s</R> snow, and people are <F>erm</F> skiing. And most <R>of</R> of them seem to be <F>erm</F> kids, but <R>so</R> some of them are couples. And <F>erm</F> I think <R>it</R> <SC>it</SC> <SC>it's</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> it seems to be <F>erm</F> very popular ski area, and the childrens are playing with snowballs and make <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> I don't know how to say in English, but this one <F>erm</F> snow doll. And also <F>erm</F> the couples are having coffee in the ski lodge and <F>erm</F> <F>er</F> one of them are just <F>erm</F> fell down <.></.> and ski. And he seems to be a beginner, and <SC>the</SC> <.></.> three of them are just <F>er</F> taking <SC>class</SC> ski class. And <F>erm</F> there is one instructor is teaching them. <F>Erm</F>.</B>

<followup>
<A>O K. Thank you, <OL><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>?</B>
<A>Yeah. Thank you. You said it snows in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>So do you ski?</A>
<B>I've never skied in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, but <SC>I</SC> I've been to ski a lot. <OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL> O K. Well, these days young people like snowboarding <F>er</F> <.></.> rather than <OL>skiing</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A>What do you think <.></.> <OL>the reason</OL>?</A>
<B>I think <OL><F>erm</F></OL> the reason, I don't know. Because of <F>er</F> <R>the</R> <R>the</R> the trend and also the fashion. And the snowboarding is a very fashionable sports, and then <F>er</F> <F>er</F> many <F>er</F> young people in oversea like Canada or <R>ot</R> other European people, <R>they</R> they <F>erm</F> <F>erm</F> do snowboarding so maybe young people like <SC>their fashionable</SC> their fashion also. And <F>erm</F> <SC>it's like more</SC> <SC>they have like <R>more</R> more the <.></.> speed</SC> they have speed. Snowboarding <SC>is</SC> has speed so <F>er</F> that's why young people like it.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. I see. But I still don't know for sure in what way, <.></.> is snowboarding more fashionable than skiing?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. Because you know, <F>erm</F> <F>er</F> I don't know if you know about the hip-hop. <F>Erm</F>. Hip-hop is a kind of dance, and it's very popular amongst <R>young</R> young people <F>erm</F> especially in <F>er</F> the United States, and then also <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> <.></.> they wear <F>er</F> a big jacket and a big T-shirts and very <R>loose</R> loose <F>erm</F> pants. And the fashion is like a almost hip-hop dancers. So and then <F>erm</F> <.></.> compare to <R>ski</R> ski <F>er</F> wear, the snowboard <F>erm</F> wear is more like a loose, and <F>erm</F> that's why the young people <F>erm</F> <F>erm</F> <SC>likes</SC> <F>erm</F> <R>like</R> like <F>er</F> the fashion.</B>
