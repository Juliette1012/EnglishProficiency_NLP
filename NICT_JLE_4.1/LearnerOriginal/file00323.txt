<A>This one. So please describe this picture for me.</A>
<B>Yes, sure. They are having a dinner at high standard restaurant. It is seven o'clock maybe in the evening because they are wearing <F>er</F> nice dresses. And yes, nice dresses, <?>or</?> dressed. And <F>mm</F> the sommelier <F>em</F> <R>brought</R> brought some champagne. I'm sure this is the champagne because the bottle is fat. <laughter>Yes</laughter>. <F>Ah</F> no, it is not a champagne because the glass that poured <?>on these, the wine</?>. It looks <laughter>wine</laughter>. Red wine. And <F>er</F> they're having a dinner. They are going to have a dinner. And they are having <F>er</F> <F>em</F> wine testing. <F>Mm</F> since the gentleman is smiling that a wine must be the <SC>nice one</SC> acceptable one for this gentleman. And <F>er</F> the lady is playing the piano. Maybe classic. Because this is <R>a</R> a kind of posh restaurant like a French. It could be Italian. I'm sure it is the French.</B>
<ctxt>phone rings</ctxt>
<B><F>Mm</F> there are three couples. <F>Mm</F> but <R>two</R> <R>two</R> two couples <F>er</F> have already <F>em</F> been eating dinners. But this very centered one <SC>hasn't</SC> <F>er</F> haven't had dinner, yet.</B>

<B>In <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>. <F>Er</F> <F>mm</F> for me, it is too snobbish.</B>
<A><nvs>giggle</nvs></A>
<B><laughter>Yes</laughter>. <R>I</R> I used to love this kind of restaurant so much when I was young and my husband was young. And <F>er</F> <SC>I</SC> we didn't have any children. We sometimes, <R>I</R> I can't say often, <SC>I sometimes</SC> we sometimes <SC>visit</SC> <R>vi</R> visited these kind restaurant. But <F>em</F> my favorite restaurant these days is <F>er</F> more lively one. We love Italian restaurant. And <F>er</F> it is located near here. And <F>em</F> it's rather noisy. And <F>er</F> <F>em</F> there are so many tables close together. And food are reasonable. The wines are reasonable. But still <F>em</F> I can feel the energy of the <R>Italian</R> Italian <R>cuis</R> cuisine. And we can enjoy it so much.</B>

<A><F>Er</F> I'm sorry, ma'am. It's against our company regulation to do that.</A>
<B>I know that <R>I</R> I think that you're gonna say this. <SC>Because</SC> but please help me. <R>I ha</R> I have to go, O K, let's say Seattle. And <F>er</F> I missed that train, and I've got job interview. And <F>er</F> <SC>I haven't got <R>to</R> to buy extra ticket</SC> <R>I</R> I haven't got the money to buy the extra ticket. So <F>eh</F> could you refund or exchange <F>er</F> the new one. Maybe the next train, please.</B>
<A>If I do it for you, then <F>er</F> I'll be fired by <R>my</R> my boss, you know. <SC>I'm</SC> <SC>it's very</SC> I can not do that at all.</A>
<B>O K. I understand. I understand. Then <F>er</F> can I <F>er</F> talk this to your boss, please?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> sure. But now she is taking a day off today. She won't be able to talk with you.</A>
<B>In that case, O K. <R>Ju</R> <R>just</R> <SC>just that do it</SC> <SC>you just</SC> <R>you</R> you <R>hide it</R> <F>eh</F> hide it. And <F>er</F> she won't see this. She won't realize this. So please do it.</B>
<A>I'm afraid I can't do that. You know, I really have to have a good reason <F>er</F> to give you another ticket.</A>
<B>Reason? Of course, my good reason is to have the job interview. But it is not good reason for you. So <F>em</F> maybe O K. <SC>This is your</SC> if it were your fault, you can give me a <F>em</F> refund or the new one. So <F>em</F> please help me. <F>Em</F> what could be possible for you to have some mistake to me?</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. I'm not sure. I'm usually pretty good at my job.</A>
<B><F>Mhm-mm</F>. I know. So <F>mm</F> then your mistake. So <F>em</F> maybe that train <F>es</F> <F>er</F> leave here <SC>slightly</SC> just slightly earlier than expected. Maybe one minute or let's say ten seconds. And I missed that train. Can you say that?</B>

<followup>
<A><F>Eh</F> you've been to many different countries. Have you ever missed airplane or train?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yes. Many many many times.</B>
<A>How did you manage?</A>
<B><F>Em</F> as matter of fact, yeah, <R>I</R> I went to <R>the</R> the guy who was standing over there, I mean in the station. And I talked like this, and managed. Then <R>most</R> most of the case was their fault. As you know in Europe and in <F>eh</F> South <R>East</R> East Asian country, <F>em</F> their <F>em</F> train schedule is terrible. They go much earlier than <R>the</R> the schedule or much later than the schedule. And so <F>em</F> <R>it</R> it didn't make me so <?>trouble</?>. <F>Mm</F>. O K.</B>

<A><OL>This</OL> is the beginning.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>That's the ending.</A>
<B><F>Mhm-hum</F>.</B>
<A>And a story took place one day last week.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>So</OL> could you also come of the own story, beginning with, "One day last week".</A>
<B><F>Mhm-hum</F>. O K. <F>Er</F> it was the story <F>mm</F> occurred one day last week. <F>Em</F> I went to the station as usual at eight o'clock in the morning. And <F>er</F> some guy standing next to me <F>eh</F> <F>eh</F> hitted me <F>eh</F> with his elbow. And <R>I</R> I dropped the luggage on the railway. <SC>It was</SC> <F>eh</F> I was so furious, and <F>eh</F> <SC>I told that <F>mm</F> <F>em</F> that guy</SC> <R>I</R> I complained about it. <F>Eh</F> and <F>er</F> asked him <SC>m pi</SC> asked him to pick up my luggage. But he said that he couldn't do this because <SC>it is so</SC> it was so dangerous. <nvs>sniff</nvs> Then the shortly after that accident, <SC>the</SC> a train came into the platform. And roll over my luggage. And I was so shocked because in that <F>er</F> luggage, <R>I had</R> <F>em</F> I had very important papers for my company. But <F>em</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I</SC> <F>eh</F> after that train <F>em</F> leave this platform, I was so relieved because my luggage is just in between of <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the railway. <F>Ur</F> so that <SC>it was not crushed</SC> it was not destroyed. <F>Em</F> <SC>it saved</SC> it save my life. And <F>em</F> then <F>er</F> the station man <SC?>in</SC?> came, and went down on <R>the</R> the railway, and get me <R>the</R> the luggage. <F>Ah</F> I went to the office as usual. It was a kind of terrible day, but in the end, it was O K.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Em</F> could you compare train systems in <H pn="others7">XXX08</H> and train systems here in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Here in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>. <F>Eh</F> in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>, <F>i</F> <F>eh</F> <F>em</F> they are well scheduled. And <SC>every train</SC> <SC>most of</SC> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> most trains come on time. And <F>eh</F> <F>mm</F> they are so clean. The most passengers are very quiet. Not really, but yes, compared to in <H pn="others7">XXX08</H>. <F>Em</F> and also, <SC>they are well</SC> <F>eh</F> other said it is well organized. The reason is that every station in Japan, we have <F>er</F> station men to see the ticket, <SC>and</SC> I mean to check the ticket, and so on. But in <H pn="others7">XXX08</H>, <F>em</F> they rarely have the station men. And the train itself is very dirty, <F>eh</F> often very <R>sme</R> smelly. And as I said <F>er</F> before, <F>er</F> train often delayed. <R>A</R> also <F>em</F> <?>O K, that sort of things</?>. In Japan, very convenient. But also <F>eh</F> <F>eh</F> yes, I can say that in <H pn="others7">XXX08</H>, <F>er</F> railway system is very convenient. Well organized compared with, I say France or Asian ones.</B>
