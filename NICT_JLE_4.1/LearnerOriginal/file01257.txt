<B><F>Mm-hm</F>. <SC>There's</SC> <SC>in</SC> <R>on the side wal</R> on the sidewalk, there's a man <F>uh</F> jogging. And close to him, there are two boys passing the ball <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>um</F> in a field. It's sort of like an open space near the house. In front of the house, there're two dogs staring at each other, I think. But I don't think they're really mad at each other because they're wagging their tails. <F>Urm</F> <SC>ne</SC> in front of the <F>ur</F> large window in their house, there's <?>just</?> girl jumping rope. <nvs>sniff</nvs> And in front of them there are two women <SC?>wo</SC?> <F>urm</F> <SC>talking</SC> gossipping, I think.

<A>this neighborhood to your neighborhood where you had lived before moving to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> my neighborhood that I used to live in wasn't this active. <SC>There was</SC> there were hardly any people because I think <SC>all the</SC> all my neighbors were pretty old like fifty or sixty. And <SC>they had</SC> all their children had gone elsewhere. And there weren't any kids around. And <SC?>mom</SC?> we lived in this, it's <F>ur</F> like a mansion, but there's only four families living in it. And <F>mm</F> there were no pets allowed so there weren't animals near. <F>Ur</F> but besides the people and the animals, it looks pretty much the same.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Mm</F> I see. <F>Oh</F> what did the people do in that neighborhood? You said that most of the inhabitants were <F>ur</F> <OL>little bit senior citizens</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yes, <F>mm-hm</F></OL> yes. <F>Urm</F> I think <SC?>there were really</SC?> there were doctors and dentists and <F>mm</F> lots of people with professional <F>eh</F> stuff. <SC>But</SC> and so I think they were working in their offices.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><R>They</R> they didn't really come out during the day time. But they seemed to stay up late at night.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see. Is there any difference between <F>ur</F> this picture to the place where you live now in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B>It's pretty different. <CO>There</CO>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>Pretty different</OL>? Tell me.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <SC>there aren't</SC> the roads aren't this wide, first of all. And <SC>there aren't any trees near</SC> <F>um</F> there are small trees but not trees like <SC>pa</SC> these pine trees. And the houses aren't big either. They are like <R>half</R> half or one-third the size of <SC>the</SC> these. And <SC>it's</SC> yeah, there is lots of houses crunched up in one <OL>space</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>. O K. <SC>I</SC> <F>ur</F> if you were inhabitant of this kind of place, what would you like to do in your free time?</A>
<B><SC>I like to buy</SC> <F>ur</F> <F>mm</F> I like to have a dog. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And I always wanted a dog but I'm allergic to <SC>dogs</SC> animals so I can't. And I wanna take them out for walk.</B>
