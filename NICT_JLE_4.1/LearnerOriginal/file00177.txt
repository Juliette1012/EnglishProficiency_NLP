<B><F>Uh-hum</F>.</B>
<A>for four days.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Oh</F> I think <R>it's a</R> it's a good idea because <F>err</F> <SC>I want to</SC> I'm not interested in sightseeing or shopping. <SC>I want</SC> I just want to relax over there. So, maybe Bali or Guam is good for me. And, I can afford to spend ten days there.

<B><F>Ohh</F> yeah.</B>
<A>Of course cheaper than Japan.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-hum</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>But</OL> not so cheap.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I can afford to spend ten days but I can't afford <SC>much mone</SC> to spend much money, so <F>err</F> do you have any discount package for Bali?</B>
<A><F>Uh-hum</F>. <F>Uh-Hum</F>. Yeah, <F>err</F> this one is <SC>only include</SC> only for <R>air</R> airfare and hotel.</A>
