<stage1>
<A>Good afternoon.</A>
<B>Good afternoon.</B>
<A>My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I ask your name?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Sure.</B>
<A>How are you today?</A>
<B>Fine, thank you.</B>
<A>Great. O K. Where do you live, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B><H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is the city <F>um</F> along <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> Line, around twenty minutes from <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> I see. Do you live <F>er</F> in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> with your family?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. That's good.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I live with my parents, younger brother and elder sister.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F> I see. So what does your brother do?</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> actually, my brother is preparing for the entrance examination to enter college.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> I see. O K. Good. All right, <F>Er</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, how often do you come to school, <H pn="school name1">XXX06</H>?</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F> since I'm now senior student, so I come to school <R>only</R> only two or three days in a week.</B>
<A>I see. So did you finish job-hunting?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> I didn't do job-hunting.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <SC>so</SC> <F>uhm</F> <.></.> <F>uhmm</F> <laughter>but</laughter> I have not decided about my future plan, yet. <F>Mhm</F> <?>but</?> <F>mhm</F> I hope to study in U K <F>mhm</F> <R>to</R> to take <SC>M A course</SC> M A programme in peace studies.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><?>Yes</?>.</B>
<A>But, why do you want to study in U K?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> I want to study <R>pe</R> peace studies, <F>eh</F> especially putting an emphasis on <F>mhm</F> conflict resolution, <F>urm</F> <F>mhm</F> ethnic or racial conflicts. <F>Mhmm</F> first of all, I can speak only Japanese and English, so <F>uhmm</F> I was trying to search Japanese <SC?>yu</SC?> graduate school <F>urr</F> where I can undertake <?>an</?> research about that area, but I couldn't find. <F>Mhm</F> it's <R>a</R> <SC?>a bits</SC?> <F>uhm</F> unfamiliar area here in Japan. So then, I consider <F>urr</F> <??></??> studying abroad, <SC>and</SC> <.></.> <F>uhm</F> of course, I also <SC>think</SC> thought about studying in <SC>U</SC> <F>uhm</F> the United States. But, I felt <F>uhm</F> <.></.> <F>urmm</F> in the United States, <F>mhm</F> the peace study is <F>mhm</F> too much related to <R>the</R> <F>urr</F> the <SC>government</SC> <SC>government's</SC> no, diplomatic policy. <R>So</R> so I decided to choose the U K as a place to study.</B>
<A>I see. But you're still thinking about it. Or you've decided to go there?</A>
<B><F>Uhmm</F> because I have two problems. One is, of course, <SC>finance</SC> finances, and the other is my English is not enough for studying there. <SC>So</SC> and also since now I'm major in law, and law is not directly related to the peace studies, so <R>I th</R> I think I have to study about that area before entering graduate school. So now, <F>mhm</F> the most possible plan after graduate next March will be <F>mhm</F> <.></.> continuing the current part-time jobs and studying by myself.</B>
<A>I see. So what is your part-time job?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> I have two kinds of part-time jobs. One is a tutor. I tutor a high school boy <F>mhm</F> once or twice in a week, and also I work in the office of a small <R>trade</R> trade company in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>. I work there on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays from <laughter><R>the morning to</R></laughter> the morning to the evening.</B>
<A>I see. It must be a tough one.</A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>
