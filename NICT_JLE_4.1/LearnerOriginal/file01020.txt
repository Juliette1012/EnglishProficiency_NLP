And <F>ah</F> the student looks <SC>very</SC> <SC>not very</SC> <R>so</R> <SC>some people</SC> some students are listening what the teacher say. But <F>ah</F> there are <SC>some people</SC> some student <SC>who are</SC> who don't listen what the teacher says. And one student is <R>drinking</R> drinking and <F>ah</F> one student <F>ah</F> chewing the gum. And also two girls are talking each other without listening what the teacher says.
