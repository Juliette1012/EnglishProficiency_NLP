<A><F>Ah</F>. Tell me more about your job.</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. Actually, <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I am a manager, so I must <F>urr</F> do manage. <F>Urr</F>. And <SC>I</SC> <R>that</R> that means <F>er</F> I must direct to <F>urr</F> my subsidiary <F>urr</F> to do something. <R>And a</R> and <SC>after working</SC> <R>af</R> after working time, <R>I</R> <R>I wan</R> I want to work as researcher, so that's the reason why I'm very busy.</B>

<B>Tokyo?</B>

That is, <F>er</F> in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city, <F>urr</F> there are not so much <F>er</F> public transportation system, compare with that <F>urr</F> Tokyo city has a good <F>ur</F> public <R>trans</R> <R>transportation sys</R> <F>urr</F> transportation system, I think.
