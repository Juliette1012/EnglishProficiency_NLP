<A>O K. Good morning. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. Can I have your name, please?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>. Good morning. <F>Um</F> I'm <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Sure.</B>
<A>O K. How are you today, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I'm a little tired</B>
<A>I'm <laughter>sure</laughter>.</A>
<B>because I've been so busy these days.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>. Especially?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> especially working.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> but it's getting warmer. That's a good thing?</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F> yes. It's better <R>to</R> <F>er</F> to have <SC>good weather</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>be</SC> warm weather. But <F>er</F> <SC>not</SC> it doesn't help a lot. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Still busy.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><OL>O K, O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>Where do you live, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>Nice place.</A>
<B>Yes. Really good place.</B>
<A>Pretty good for access, I think.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Because <F>er</F> new subway <F>er</F> just <F>er</F> came into operation</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>two years ago</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And then</OL> <F>mm</F> I can go anywhere quite easily. <F>Er</F> so it's very, very convenient.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Apart from the convenience,</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>could you tell me some other <F>um</F> advantages of living in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Er</F> there are two famous parks. One is <F>er</F> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. And the other is <F>er</F> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. And both of then are very, very good because there are so many green trees and flowers in the spring. And <F>er</F> we can just go and visit and feel relax. And <F>uh</F> also there is a museum and a museum park. So it's a very nice museum because the building <F>er</F> was built, I think <F>er</F> <F>eh</F> at the very beginning of the twentieth century.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>And it's a very nice <F>er</F> building.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>So I like my area very much.</B>
<A>Good way to spend time.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> apart from that and apart from your business and your work, <F>um</F> what do you like to do <R>when you</R> when you do have extra time?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I like to <F>er</F> listening to C D's.</B>
<A>C D's.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>Particularly what kind of music?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> Japanese pop music.</B>
<A>Japanese pop music.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> Yes.</B>
<A>Not Western.</A>
<B>No.</B>
<A><F>Er</F> what's the difference between Japanese pop music and Western <OL><R>rock</R> rock music</OL> or pop music?</A>
<B><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>. I think <F>um</F> basically same because <SC>al</SC> most of the Japanese <F>mm</F> pop musicians try to imitate <F>er</F> the way of <F>er</F> playing or singing of the Western singers. So it's <R>m</R> <F>er</F> mostly I think about the same. But <F>mm</F> big difference is language.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><R>O</R> <SC>o</SC> <F>mm</F> <laughter>because</laughter> of course a lot of Japanese singers sing in Japanese. So that's a <nvs>laughter</nvs> big difference. So I mean the words are <F>er</F> different. But as far as the music is concerned, it's very similar, I guess.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>But I presume you can hear</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>and understand English words.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>So the language is not a big problem.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yeah, not a big problem for me. But <F>er</F> I like <F>er</F> Western <F>er</F> or especially American music <F>er</F> in the seventies</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><?>and</?></OL> eighties. <laughter>That means</laughter> at that time I was very young. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Aren't we all? O K.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>First of all <SC>to</SC> I want to show you a picture, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. <F>Um</F> I'd like you to <SC>ima</SC> look at this and describe this for me.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. O K. This is a classroom of a high school and this is a class of mathematics. And I think a teacher is teaching mathematics. However, <F>er</F> only one student <F>uh</F> in the front row is <nvs>laughter</nvs> studying. But other students are not listening <F>er</F> her lecture. <F>Er</F> one <laughter><SC?>man</SC?> boy who looks very old</laughter>, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>um</F> he is chewing gum. And two girls are chatting. And he is <F>er</F> drinking <F>er</F> something <F>er</F> <SC>while listening</SC> <F>er</F> he's listening to music with his <F>er</F> Walkman. And <SC>she i</SC> this girl is <F>er</F> using her cellphone.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Now, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, <F>um</F> <SC>going way back, I guess, <F>mm</F> how</SC> <F>er</F> going back to your high school,</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>um</F> what differences do you remember between your high school experience and this kind of <OL>scenario</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>. <F>Er</F> the big difference is that, in my high school, <F>er</F> all the students studied very hard because we had to <F>er</F> pass the entrance examination <F>er</F> <SC>to be enter</SC> <R>to</R> to enter <F>er</F> universities. So we studied very hard. And also we had a kind of <F>er</F> <SC>uni</SC> school uniform. Of course it was not a mandatory. So <R>i</R> if you want, <R>you</R> <OL><SC>you can</SC></OL> <F>er</F> you could <F>ur</F> <F>er</F> wear <SC>u</SC> school uniforms one day and <F>uh</F> on another occasion, you can just <F>er</F> wear anything you want</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL> <F>Hm</F>. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>even the</OL> jeans.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So that was a kind of very, very free <F>um</F> school.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Pretty casual.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. You mentioned the examinations that you had to study for. That's the purpose of going to school.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Er</F>.</A>
<B><F>Uh</F> one of the purpose, <OL>I guess</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>One of the</OL> <OL>purposes</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Er</F> do you think that's changed? <F>Er</F> recently <SC>this</SC> less emphasis on that?</A>
<B><F>Hm</F> no, I don't think so.</B>
<A><OL>It's still the same</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>I see a lot</OL> of students wants to get into colleges.</B>
<A>So that hasn't changed.</A>
<B>No.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> what do you think about that? Is that <R>a</R> <F>ur</F> <R>a</R> <R>a</R> a good way to educate young people?</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>. <nvs>smack</nvs> It's not a very, very good way. But <F>er</F> it's something that you have to go through anyway. Because <SC>you have to</SC> I think they hire <F>er</F> level of education at <F>er</F> university level is necessary for the nation as a whole. So <R>of</R> of course <F>er</F> <F>um</F> many young men should study at universities. But the problem is all the <laughter>students</laughter> wants to get in. That's a problem.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So <SC>I</OL> think even</SC> <F>er</F> I think only the students who are <F>mm</F> eager to study really should go there.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So that's a problem. But <SC>the</SC> I think the way of <F>er</F> entrance examination <SC?>ch</SC?> is O K.</B>
<A>It's O K.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>Yeah. O K. Thank you very much.</A>

<A>But this happened before.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>So please start your story "One day last week," and then begin.</A>
<B>O K. One day last week, I went to a department store to buy a happy birthday present for my husband. <F>Er</F> I thought a tie would be nice and I just straight go to the tie section, and I found a very nice <F>er</F> green tie with <F>er</F> brown dots. And <SC>I</SC> <SC>it was</SC> although it was a little expensive, I didn't bother to <SC>bu</SC> pay a lot of money because that's a present. So I asked the sales clerk to wrap <F>er</F> it as a present. And he wrap it nicely with a red ribbon. And I paid in cash. And on the way back home <SC>I</SC> in the department store, I found a final sale of shoes. <F>Er</F> it was written <JP><SC>san</SC></JP> three percent off. And "<F>Oh</F>," I thought, "it's cheap.". And I was so glad. So I bought a pair of shoes <SC>for my</SC> for me. And then next <F>er</F> section, I found <F>er</F> fifty percent off <nvs>laughter</nvs> sales of clothes for ladies. And I was so happy. And I bought a very nice <F>er</F> yellow sweater. So <nvs>laughter</nvs> when I went out to the department store, I end up with buying a lot of things for myself and one nice gift for my husband.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>

<A><OL><R>Don't fo</R></OL> don't forget your husband.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Now, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, I believe that <F>um</F> from the signs on the train and from my experience that the bargains are very, very popular, department stores, that kind of place. <F>Um</F> of course because they're cheap. But the stores themselves really advertise</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>bargains or something.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>Wha</R></OL> what is the appeal of bargain?</A>
<B><CO><F>Well</F> <OL>I</OL></CO>.</B>
<A><OL>Except</OL> just the price, of course.</A>
<B>I think <F>er</F> the quality, too. They want to appeal <F>er</F> they can <F>er</F> offer a good thing <F>er</F> at a very certain low price. So <R>tha</R> <SC>that's one of their <F>er</F> point <R>to</R> to</SC> <R>tha</R> that's a very <SC>ni</SC> good point that they want to show. So <F>er</F> what else? <nvs>laughter</nvs> <CO>Wha</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> bearing that in mind, why don't they have <F>uh</F> cheaper prices in the first place?</A>
<B>Because if <R>i</R> it was very cheap from the beginning, you can't compare. <F>Uh</F> because <R>u</R> <SC?>you</SC?> usually the customers compare. They often just visit and don't buy anything and just <SC>look fo</SC> <SC>look a</SC> <SC>look for</SC> <F>er</F> <F>uh</F> look around <F>er</F> in the department store. And <SC>they</SC> the customers know the price very much. And then maybe one month later, it is discounted fifty percent, then they can <laughter>buy</laughter>. <laughter>So if it was <SC>s</SC></laughter> cheap from the beginning, they think, "<F>Oh</F> it must be a very, very <SC>bad</SC> bad quality." or something like that. Of course if they check by themselves, they can know. But usually, they compare the <SC>price</SC></B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>prices</OL>.</B>
<A>Right. Right. Right. Is that the way you do your own shopping?</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>. No, not really. I don't like <F>er</F> sales. Because there're so many people.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>It's too crowded for me. So I just rather want to go shopping in a very quiet store. And of <laughter>course, if it is very, very</laughter> expensive, I don't buy <OL>anything</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But if it is a reasonable price, I will buy.</B>
