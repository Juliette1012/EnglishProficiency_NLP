<B>Yes, I am a fresh man.</B>
<A><F>Uhh</F> I see. How do you like your job?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I think it's O K. It suits me.</B>
<A><F>Uhh</F> <?>It suits</?>. <F>Urr</F> And in what sense do you think so?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I belong to the <F>ur</F> accounting department. And <F>um</F> <F>oh</F> <SC><R>I</R> I like figures</SC> <SC>I like looking at</SC> I like analyzing <R>what</R> what <F>ur</F> actual figures mean. And <F>um</F> <SC>I think</SC> <SC>that's</SC> <F>um</F> I think</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>I like it.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F> You're in the accounting division.</A>
<B>Yes, I am.</B>
<A>O K. Then what kind of skills are required to your job?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> I'm not in a accounting division. <SC>I</SC> I'm in the liner division, and I do the accounting for the liner division which means <F>um</F> I don't do the accounting for the whole company. <SC>I</SC> <R>it's</R> it's just divisional <F>ur</F> accounting. And <F>um</F> <R>o</R> <F>u</F> of course accounting skill or knowledge or <F>um</F> <SC>they</SC> <R>that's</R> that's required. I now been studying that <F>ur</F> <SC>when I</SC> since I came into the company. And, <F>um</F> <F>well</F> yeah, basic <R>accoun</R> accounting skills and <F>um</F> <R>what</R> what the figures mean and <F>ur</F> <SC>actual</SC> yeah, <R>that's</R> that's about it.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F> How do you study this?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> <F>well</F> basically the accounting skill or knowledge I read books or the company <R>let</R> <SC>let</SC> lets me <F>urm</F> go to accounting schools. <F>Uh</F> <R>Not</R> <R>not</R> not at the moment. But <R>I</R> I went to <F>urm</F> several accounting schools in May and June. And <F>um</F> <F>well</F> <SC><R>to</R> to figure out <SC>what accounting</SC> what <R>the</R> the figures mean for each</SC> <F>urm</F> <R>what</R> what the actual figures mean, or after <SC>I look at <F>um</F> of</SC> I look at a lot of <F>ur</F> <SC>books</SC> <F>mm</F> accounting books and then I calculate <R>how</R> how the figures calculate. Yeah.</B>
<A>Sounds difficult. O K. <F>Urr</F> Do you have any hobbies by the way? So what do you do on the weekends?</A>
<B>Weekends.</B>
<A>Spare time.</A>
<B><SC>I'm</SC> <R>I</R> <F>ur</F> I do athletics. <R>I</R> <F>ur</F> I do long distances. And <F>urm</F> <SC>this Fri</SC> <SC>this, no</SC> <SC>this Saturday, no</SC> this Sunday, I'm going to be running a <SC>marathon</SC> full marathon. So I've been practicing for that on weekends.</B>
<A>Marathon.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Uhh</F> Tell me more about the marathon competition this Sunday?</A>
<B>Yeah. <SC?>It so</SC?> <SC>it's just</SC> <F>ur</F> you know, <R>it's</R> <R>it's</R> it's like <F>ur</F> when New York Marathon where all citizens take part. I do it. That's <F>ur</F> Kawaguchi <JP>ko</JP> Lake in <F>ur</F> <SC>Yamaguchi</SC> Yamanashi Prefecture. <F>Urm</F> <R>Have you</R> have you been to Kawaguchi <JP>ko</JP>?</B>
<A>Kawaguchi <JP>ko</JP>? No.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> you sort of <R>run</R> run the lake twice. And <R>that</R> that makes forty two point one nine five kilo meters. It's my fifth challenge.</B>
<A>Fifth challenge. <F>Wow</F> Great. Then how did you get interested in running?</A>
<B>Running. <F>Ur</F> <F>Well</F> <R>I</R> I started running when I came into university, that was my first time. <SC>I did</SC> <R>I</R> I didn't belong <R>to</R> <F>ur</F> to <F>ur</F> athletic club when I was in a senior high school. But <F>ur</F> I was pretty fast. And <F>um</F> I'm good at long distances <SC>although I was</SC> <F>um</F> though I didn't belong to the athletic club. And <F>um</F> <F>mm</F> I thought I might, you know, start.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F> I see. <F>Ur</F> Did you see women's marathon yesterday?</A>
<B>No, <SC>I no</SC> <R>I</R> I didn't actually. <F>Ur</F> <SC>I was</SC> no, I didn't.</B>
<A><F>Uhh</F> I see. Then what do you think about Takahashi Naoko?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> No. <nvs>laughter</nvs> I mean <F>ur</F> I don't think I have the rights to comment <F>ur</F> about her because <F>ur</F> <R>she's</R> she's most professional, and <F>ur</F> most fastest runner in the world,</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F></A>
<B>I think.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> I see. O K. Thank you very much.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>Now, I'd like to show you a picture. Here, and please describe it for me.</A>
<B><F>Ohh</F> This is a picture <F>ur</F> of <F>ur</F> class room, I think about <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> <R>junior high</R> junior high school. <SC>Teach</SC> the teacher is teaching <SC>math</SC> mathematics to the students although only a few of the students <SC>are listening to her</SC> listen to her. And <F>ur</F> most of the students are doing something else.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F> O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Then why do you think students are not <F>ur</F> listening to her?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> one, I think because students aren't interested in mathematics. And two, <F>mm</F> because <F>mm</F> probably <R>the</R> the way the teacher teaches is not that good at all. She's not teaching mathematics interesting. Or three, <SC>probably</SC> <F>urm</F> it's probably nothing to do with examination.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F> For example, <SC>how can you sh</SC> <F>urr</F> how can she make <SC>the class</SC> the lecture more interesting?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> Very good question. <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> usually, mathematics teachers, they try to describe everything using <F>ur</F> figures. But <F>urm</F> <R>if</R> if she's not interesting or most of the students aren't interested in figures, that <F>urm</F> if the teacher tries to explain everything in figures, I guess <R>it'll</R> it'll be difficult <F>ur</F> interest the students. So I think the teachers should <F>urm</F> explain mathematics rather not using figures, but using something else. Using like words or <F>ur</F> examples that are more close to you.</B>
<A><F>Uhh</F> That's a good idea. O K. Then is there any difference between this picture and your high school days?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>The class room in your high school days.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>ur</F> <F>well</F> <F>urm</F> pretty much the same, I think. But <F>um</F> I think I listened to the teacher.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>?</A>
<B>But I think I was listening to the teacher. Pretty much the same, I think.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F></B>
<A>How about students?</A>
<B>Students. <F>Um</F> <F>urm</F> <F>well</F> this is much worse, I think than my high school days. <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>we</SC> first of all, we didn't have cell phones in a high school days. So no one was playing around with cell phones, but there were students chatting or chewing gums or drinking or listening to music. So yeah, I guess pretty much the same.</B>
<A>I see. O K.</A>

<A>Why is it difficult to have <SC>a party</SC> a home party in Japan?</A>

However Steve <F>urr</F> no, he didn't <laughter>avoid accident</laughter>. <F>Urm</F> <R>He avoided</R>, yeah he avoided <F>ur</F> <SC>tragedy</SC> a big accident. <R>However</R> <.></.> however <F>ur</F> <SC>he</SC> the car didn't hit Steve himself but it hit Steve's motorbike. On the other hand, <F>urr</F> when John hit a <F>urr</F> Steve's motorbike, Steve <SC>throw</SC> <F>ur</F> dropped his cell phone which means that <F>ur</F> Steve broke both his motorbike and his cell phone.
