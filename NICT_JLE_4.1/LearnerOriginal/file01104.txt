<B>One day last week, I and my boyfriend were walking on the street <SC>going to</SC> going back home. And it was raining, and it was a little cold day. Anyway <SC>while I was wal</SC> <F>urr</F> while we were walking, my boyfriend heard <F>ur</F> <SC>little voice</SC> little noise. And we found a stray cats on the street. <SC>It was</SC> <F>urr</F> I felt pity <SC>on him</SC> on her so <SC>I picked</SC> I hold him, and that came out of the box. And I asked my boyfriend to take her back to our home together with us. But my boyfriend said no. But <R>I asked</R> I asked him again and again, and he said O K for finally. And <SC>we take her together, <.></.> and we were</SC> we take her together, and <F>ur</F> decided to <R>have</R> have her <R>as our</R> as our new member of our house.</B>

</task>
<followup>
<A>Did you ever have any pets?</A>
<B>Yes. <SC>I have a</SC> in my <SC>home</SC> back home in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>, we have a dog. And he's living almost over fifteen years. He lives a long time.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. Never had any pets so can you tell me about <F>um</F> some of the advantages to have a dog?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F> <F>well</F> we started to having him <SC>since <F>ur</F> in my</SC> when I was like seven years old or eight years old. Before having him, <SC>I was really scary</SC> <SC>I felt</SC> I was afraid of at any animals. <SC>I hate</SC> I hated dogs. I hated cats. And I hated any other animals. But I got used to him. I bring with him and taking him to a walk. That's my advantage. And all our family, he barks you <R>out</R> outcomers so <SC>he</SC> it's very <R>good</R> good at <F>mm</F> guarding our house.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. But he sometimes bark too much, and yeah, and one time <SC>he bit on the people</SC> <F>ur</F> he bit on my uncle, and <SC>that was not</SC> that was the disadvantage. But we love him, and we really enjoy having him. Yes.</B>
<A>When your dog <F>ur</F> bit your uncle, what did you do?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC>he</SC> my uncle, he didn't really like our dog. So maybe what happened was <R>he</R> <F>mm</F> <SC>he found</SC> he felt my uncle's feeling, <R>and</R> and <SC>my uncle was not really</SC> <F>ur</F> <.></.> <SC>he was</SC> <SC>he didn't really</SC> he didn't often come to our house. <SC>He wasn't</SC> he was new to our house at that time so he thought he was outsider, <F>um</F> not outsider, but he was dangerous. <SC>He thought</SC> our dog thought my uncle was dangerous for our <R>fami</R> family or our house. So that's what happened, I think. And <SC>I</SC> my parents <SC>took him to</SC> took my uncle to hospital, and <SC>I</SC> we all told our dog that was the bad thing. And <SC>he taugh</SC> we taught him not to do anymore.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see. What do you think of the people who treat their pets badly?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I think <SC>they don't have</SC> they shouldn't have pets in that way. <SC>Pets are not to</SC> I don't think pets are not to abuse. <SC>They should</SC> <F>mm</F> yes, having pets is very <R>ad</R> advantage for <F>urm</F> teaching little children to love something, <R>not</R> not something, but <R>some</R> some animal or some other existence. But it's not to like beat them or abuse them. So if they don't really like to have pets or <F>mm</F> just to free the stress and hit them, they shouldn't have that way. Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see.</A>
