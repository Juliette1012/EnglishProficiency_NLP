<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> Not very far. <CO>But</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Can you tell me more about your town?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> sure. <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is <F>urm</F> <F>urm</F> residential area. <F>Ur</F> it used be <F>urm</F> a bit risky, not safe area, but recently many shops are coming in, and <F>urm</F> nice shopping area as well. So I really like living there. We got <SC>a house</SC> <F>ur</F> not a house but apartment <F>ur</F> after marriage. And we've been there for <F>urm</F> four years. Yeah. <OL>I really like it</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>You said</OL> <F>ur</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> used be <F>ur</F> risky area. <OL>What do you mean by that</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yeah, I heard about it</OL>. I heard, but when we moved in, <SC>it has been</SC> it had been already developed well. Yeah. But some peoples says that <F>ur</F> there're many drinking places so <F>urm</F> some old guys drink from day time, and <nvs>laughter</nvs> some drunken guys around the station, they used be.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. I see. You said you're married.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> yeah.</B>
<A>Can you tell me about your husband?</A>
<B><F>Uhh</F> marriage, yeah. We met in <F>ur</F> States in <H pn="school name1">XXX04</H>. <F>Urm</F> the first time, we met at <F>ur</F> golf driving range. I was really bad at golf at the time. <laughter>And</laughter> my husband <F>ur</F> to be at that time, found me, and, "What a awful golfer," he thought. And then he started teaching me, that was the first time we met. And then we came back together. And <F>ur</F> I started working for <?><H pn="company name1">XXX05</H></?>, and my husband works for a construction company in Japan. Then after two years, we got married.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>You said <H pn="school name1">XXX04</H> <OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah, we studied</OL> <H pn="school name1">XXX04</H> together.</B>
<A>Why did you decide to study <OL>at <H pn="school name1">XXX04</H></OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Ur</F> study</OL> there? <F>Urm</F> fortunately, they had the same research program as what I studied in Tokyo. And they had <F>ur</F> <SC>common</SC> <F>ur</F> the same research program, and my professor in Tokyo <F>urm</F> offered me to do the same researching in the States. And <R>I</R> I was really interested in studying abroad. So yeah, I asked him, "Can I go there, and <F>ur</F> do the same research, and bring back for my master degree?". So it was really lucky for me. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>. I see. <SC>Having working</SC> <F>ur</F> have you been working this company for long time?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> it has been four years.</B>
<A>Four years?</A>
<B>Yeah. And actually I studied the biochemistry and <SC>doing</SC> now I'm doing <F>ur</F> marketing so totally different. But the <?><H pn="company name1">XXX05</H></?> doesn't really <F>urm</F> care what your background is. And actually <SC>the research</SC> in terms of research, it's the same of the marketing method and <F>ur</F> biochemistry method. You make a hypothesis, and research, and prove, then next step. So the step is the same. Only the difference is <F>ur</F> bacteria or human beings. So that's the difference I find.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>So you like your job.</A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>.</A>
<B>So far. Yeah.</B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>Now, I would like to show you a picture.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A><..></..> O K. Please describe this picture.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Urm</F> here, this is a ski slope in a winter mountain. And plenty of snow and <F>ur</F> plenty of skiers there. Some people <F>urm</F> skiing. And some people are playing with <R>the</R> the snowballs throwing each other. <F>Urm</F> there is the cottage, and a couple is enjoying <F>urr</F> the coffee, and maybe chatting together. And one of the skiers are in the snow with one of the skies off from his foot. And maybe he needs help, but no one is approaching to him. And <F>ur</F> one of the skiers, <F>urm</F> not ski, he's not on the ski, but <F>ur</F> snowboard. And he's enjoying snowboarding in <F>ur</F> deep thick snow. And no one is on the chairs. So I guess <SC>this mountain</SC> this ski slope is not so crowded. And on the right hand side, there is a coach. <F>Urm</F> I guess he is the coach because he's <F>urm</F> giving a sign to one of the girls <F>ur</F> approaching to <R>the</R> the coach and the other students. And she looks a bit nervous. She's just staring at her <F>ur</F> front, just watching straight and trying to keep her <F>ur</F> <JP>bougen</JP>.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. O K. Thank you <R>ve</R> very much.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Did you ever go skiing?</A>
<B>Yeah. I love it.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> you love it.</A>
<B>Yeah. <R>I</R> I used to belong the ski team.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Do you remember the last time <OL>you went skiing</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Last time</OL> I skied was in Nagano. It was in <F>ur</F> Shigakogen. It's a big big snow slope. And <F>ur</F> you can spend like three days trying all the chairs. It's a huge mountain, and it's one of my favorite place.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> so you're very good skier so</A>
<B>I used to be. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> if you were instructor, <F>ur</F> <R>how would you</R> how would you help the beginner,</A>
<B>Beginner.</B>
<A>to improve <OL>their skill</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>. <F>Urm</F> actually, <SC>that's what I</SC> <R>I</R> I used to do <F>ur</F> instructor, and <SC>the</SC> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>one of <SC>the metho</SC> the best method I thought was <F>urr</F> start skiing without the poles. Because if you have poles on your hands, then your focus is both on your skies and poles. And you're more likely destructed. But without poles, you can really concentrate on the <SC>foot and</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>fo</R> foot and <F>ur</F> skies. So it's the better way to start skiing. And also you feel really <F>ur</F> afraid when you first try the chairs. <F>Ur</F> <laughter><SC>when you start</SC></laughter> when you sit down on the chairs, and also take off the chairs, <F>ur</F> some beginners <F>urr</F> get the poles stuck on the snow, and some people really <F>urm</F> getting trouble sticking on the poles and your body <SC>stick</SC> stuck on the poles, and <F>ur</F> finally chairs stop. And people start complaining to you. So the best way is without poles. Yeah. After one day, <SC>you can really find the</SC> yeah, you can ski without poles.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> good advice. I'm a beginner. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> You should try it.</B>
<A>O K. I'll try.</A>

But <F>ur</F> actually my mom got sick last night, and <F>ur</F> this morning, <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <SC>I went</SC> I visited her. But <F>ur</F> her condition was really in <F>ur</F> bad. And I took her to the hospital, and <F>ur</F> <R>she</R> she needed to go straight to <R>the</R> the intensive care room. So <R>I</R> I needed to be with her. And I try to call you, call you, call you. But maybe you were busy preparing for the dinner party. <F>Urm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> but <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, the party was very important party.</A>

<A>And <R>I</R> I think I saw your mother yesterday.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> really? <OL>When</OL>?</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Erm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Near</OL> the station. So sure?</A>
<B>Yeah, that's <SC>what</SC> why we got so surprised and shocked. Because <F>ur</F> she was in a good shape during the day time. And late night, <F>urm</F> she suddenly <F>urm</F> felt sick, and my father called me and something wrong <F>urm</F> is happening on my mom. And <F>ur</F> <R>he</R> he needed my help. And <R>I</R> I went to her house. And it was really sudden <F>ur</F> accident, and we haven't really found out what happened. But <F>urm</F> I feel sorry, and next time <SC>I</SC> I'm eager to <F>urm</F> join your party if possible. <SC>You</SC> could you invite me for the next time?</B>
<A>Yeah. But I don't know how to apologize to the friends I invited.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> yeah, <SC>I</SC> you are the first one I called since last night, and yeah, maybe <R>I</R> I will see them this week. And <F>ur</F> I will apologize from my side as well. So yeah, I know that the party was really important, and I was looking forward to it. And hopefully by the next Friday, if my mom will get better. <F>Urm</F>.</B>

<A><OL>This is end</OL> of the role play.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>So <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, do you like parties?</A>
<B><R>I</R> I love it. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>

<B><R>I</R> I like talking to many people.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. Even in Japan?</A>
<B>Sorry?</B>
<A>Even in Japan, <OL>do you have</OL> many parties?</A>
<B><OL>Even in Japan</OL>? Yes. <F>Urr</F> since I came back from the States, I often hold a home party. <F>Urm</F> because I learned how to <F>ur</F> have a home party in the States. It's not very formal. Just <F>urm</F> with the close friends. And some people don't know <F>ur</F> other people in the party, but it doesn't matter, they can <F>urm</F> introduce each other. Then just chatting, chatting, and <F>ur</F> drink, and eat. That's a nice <F>ur</F> chance to see each other. And sometimes I'm really surprised at the, for example, you have not met <F>ur</F> my friends, but <F>urm</F> coincidentally, you know someone who they know really well. And then they start <F>ur</F> next conversation, and <F>ur</F> <F>urm</F> have the common <F>urm</F> stories, and, "<F>Wow</F> did you know her?". And <R>you</R> you get surprised, but it's a <R>nice</R> nice surprise <R>to</R> to develop the <F>ur</F> other stories as well. So that's the good thing to have a home party, and invite the different kinds of friends.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>

<A>Please start.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Urm</F> <.></.> a guy was driving <F>urm</F> his orange car, not very big, <F>urm</F> tiny, but looks comfortable car. <F>Urm</F> then from the other side, another guy on the bike was coming talking on his mobile phone, <F>urm</F> talking to maybe his girlfriend. He looks so happy. Then the next moment, the orange car hit <F>urm</F> the back of the bike, and the biker dropped his mobile phone. They got surprised at the same time. Of course, the biker got mad. He looked really angry, and started complaining, "<F>Oh</F> shame, it's my bike got broken. The back of the bike is totally broken. Also my mobile is broken.". Then the driver in the orange car <F>urm</F> pick up the mobile phone. And the police came to the two, and <F>ur</F> started <F>ur</F> taking a note of their dictation. The driver started <F>ur</F> explaining what happened holding the mobile phone of the biker. The biker doesn't seem happy, of course. Then <F>urm</F> after police <F>ur</F> finish the dictation, the big truck came to <F>urr</F> pick up the broken bike. And the biker <F>ur</F> <SC>is</SC> was watching the truck taking his bike maybe to the garage. The biker look a bit sad <F>urm</F> having his <F>ur</F> helmet on his hands. <OL>That's the end of the story</OL>.</B>

<A>Do you have a driver's license?</A>

<B><F>Urm</F> yes. I should know. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter><??></??></laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><laughter><?>So tell me the</?></laughter></OL> procedure.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Urm</F> when you have an accident on a street, first, <F>urm</F> you have to pull over on the street, and <F>ur</F> you have to stop. Then <F>urm</F> get out of the car. And, O K, this is the situation when you hit the <F>urm</F> other person. Then <F>ur</F> of course the other person is supposed to be <SC>with</SC> around <SC>your</SC> my car. Then we have to call first to the police <F>ur</F> wherever or whenever. Then you should be there. <F>Ur</F> you shouldn't change anything because <F>ur</F> proof must be there. Then when the police <F>ur</F> arrived to your site, then start explaining. But they say <R>exep</R> exceptionally, <F>ur</F> the other person is injured or if you are injured, then call police, and at the same time, you have to call to the emergency <F>ur</F> to have a emergency car. And <F>ur</F> if it is really urgent, you need to do something on the other person. Then you should do <F>urm</F> like <F>ur</F> heart pressing or <F>urr</F> urgent <F>urm</F> <R>take</R> take care <R>for</R> for the other person. But the basic <F>ur</F> rule is to call to the police.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. <F>Mhm</F> sounds like you know everything.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>You're ready to have one. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
