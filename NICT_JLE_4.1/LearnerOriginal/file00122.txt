<B><ctxt>the interviewee is looking at the picture</ctxt> <F>Oh</F> this <?>is</?> very lovely picture. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Yeah, I think <F>mm</F> it's in the a morning, you know, yeah, the sun is shining. And you can see the boys, they're playing the ball, and green, yes, and one man maybe. <R>He's</R> <F>uh</F> he's on the holiday. He's just running. Yes. <nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. And we can also find two dogs. They're also playing together, and, yes, and <SC>two woman</SC> two women, maybe they're neighbors. Yeah, <SC>they <??></??></SC> they say, "<F>Oh</F> hello," "Good morning," yes. <F>Oh</F> <?>that's very interesting</?> <F>ur</F> cat. <nvs>laughter</nvs> It is lying on the car. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Yes. <F>Oh</F> <?>you know</?> this is a man.

</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. Thank you.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>So you said</OL> you are living <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>, right now.</A>
<B>Yes, right.</B>
<A>How do you compare this picture</A>
<B><CO><OL>To <H pn="others4">XXX06</H></OL></CO>.</B>
<A><OL>to your</OL> neighborhood in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>?</A>
<B><F>Nhm</F> yes. <SC>In</SC> <SC>I ca</SC> I think if you go out in the morning, you can find <SC>women</SC> housewives, they take care dogs to have a walk, and they talk to each other. Yes, also, yes, you can find a people, they are running <?>in there</?> early morning.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Really?</A>
<B>Yeah. But it's difficult for me to find a person to read a <?>magazine</?> in the park. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>Why is that</OL>? Do you know? Why do you think it's difficult to find that kind of person in Japan?</A>
<B>They have no time. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>. <F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>They prefer to staying at home, or I don't know. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K. Then could you describe the neighborhood in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> where you grew up?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> <SC>the neighborhood</SC> I think in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, the neighborhood, they are <R>more close</R> <SC>more close</SC> closer than the Japanese.</B>
<A>What do you mean by closer?</A>
<B><F>Umm</F>. <.></.> How to say. <SC>If</SC> they <SC>speak very much</SC> <R>s</R> speak a lot if they meet each other, and also say, "Hello, hello.". Yes, <F>oh</F> for example, "<F>Oh</F> <F>uhm</F> what are you doing today?". "<F>Oh</F> <SC>what are y</SC> what did you do yesterday?". Or they just talk very much. But in Japan, I think the neighbor, <R>they</R> they choose <SC>some nei</SC> <R>so</R> some people to be the friends maybe to talk to each other. But they don't talk to everybody <SC>on</SC> around them. Yes. <F>Mhm</F>. So just a <F>um</F> <?>beside man house</?>, yes.</B>
<A>Is it difficult <OL>for you</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yes, very</OL> <F>umm</F>. But <R>this</R> <SC>this family is <SC>very</SC> <R>a little bit</R> a little bit</SC>, how to say, <F>umm</F> maybe stranger <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> is not good, but I can found such <?>forward</?> now. Yeah, this <?>family</?>, they have many garbage just out of their house, you know. Really, but this is their area. So nobody <R>can</R> can you say, "<F>Oh</F> you can not.". But <R>what they</R> what they are doing, I can not understand. Because in my mind, Japanese is the very very clear. They like <?>deal near the</?> clean the house very very beautifully. Yes. <SC>It's very</SC> maybe it's <?>in</?> an <F>nh</F> exception. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
