<A><laughter><F>Oh</F> really</laughter>? But it's a most difficult thing to teach her.</A>

<A>Is she a good student?</A>
<B>No. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><laughter>No</laughter></OL>. O K, thank you very much.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K, today, first of all, <F>ur</F> O K. I'll show a picture here.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>So please describe this picture in detail.</A>
<B>O K. <SC>There is a</SC> <F>ah</F> it's a scene of class. <R>I</R> <F>ah</F> I think it's a mathematics class. And there are one, two, three, four, five, <R>six stu</R> <F>ah</F> <SC>six students</SC> seven students and <F>umm</F> one teacher. And teacher is instructing some difficult <F>ah</F> <R>mathmatics</R> mathematics. <F>Ahh</F> but <SC>they</SC> <F>hmm</F> <SC>almost</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>two</SC> <F>ah</F> <SC>near</SC> only one student is listening carefully. And <SC>other</SC> <SC>others does</SC> others don't listen. Maybe <R>they</R> <F>ur</F> they don't like teacher, or they don't like mathematics, but it's a typical Japanese <F>er</F> class in today, I think.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K, thank you very much. So you said this is a typical Japanese class. And compared to this <F>ah</F> picture, what were your school days like?</A>
<B>You mean today's Japanese class?</B>
<A><F>Um-hm</F>.</A>
<B>I think <F>hmm</F> <R>today's</R> <F>ah</F> today's Japanese <F>er</F> class is <F>am</F> little difficult situation from <R>two</R> two point. One point is that <SC>students doesn't</SC> <F>ah</F> students don't like to study because <F>er</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> they are lack of <?>faith</?>. And <F>mm</F> other point is <F>em</F> teacher's lack of ability. I mean they can't scold them out. <SC>Sco</SC> and they can't point out what's wrong. And <R>that's</R> that's a problem of <R>our</R> <F>ahh</F> our countries, I think.</B>
<A>O K, thank you very much. By the way, what do you do?</A>
<B><SC>I'm</SC> do you know <JP>juku</JP> in Japanese?</B>
<A><F>Um-hm</F>. Yeah.</A>
<B>I'm a <JP>juku</JP> tutor.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> really? <F>Wow</F>. Sounds difficult. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>No.</B>
<A>So do you have the same problem with her? <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>I <F>um</F> mainly teach <F>ahh</F> two students <F>ah</F> each. It's a personal children in <JP>juku</JP>. So <SC>they don't</SC> <F>ah</F> when person to person, they stay silent, calm, and they listen to me. But <SC>if he</SC> if they <nvs>laughter</nvs> become more numbers, <F>ah</F> about forty or thirty, they become <nvs>laughter</nvs> like this.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> I think so. O K, thank you very much.</A>

<B>In Japan?</B>
<A>In Japan.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> we don't have much parties so I've never been this kind of situation.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really? <F>Oh</F> that's good. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And <SC>do you have</SC> <F>ah</F> do you often have party or any kind of party?</A>

<B>Yes. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Sounds difficult. O K. Compared to English, what's the most difficult point to <SC>studying</SC> study French.</A>
<B>French. <SC>There are no person</SC> <F>ah</F> there isn't any person who speak French in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. So it's a very difficult to contact to <F>ah</F> <F>um</F> <R>active French</R> active <F>ah</F> French speaker. <F>Ah</F> so <F>ah</F> if you study English, there are lot of materials, <F>ah</F> radio and TV or newspapers. But <F>ahh</F> when it comes to French, it's <F>ah</F> not so much <F>ah</F> material or texts. So it's the point of <F>ah</F> difficult.</B>
