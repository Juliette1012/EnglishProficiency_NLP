<A><H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>Nice to meet you.</A>
<B>Nice to meet you.</B>
<A>So how are you today?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F> I'm O K. But I'm so nervous.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Because this is the test</OL>. You know, students <F>er</F> don't want to take a test. <F>Er</F> <R>I</R> I also don't want to take a test.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><OL>Yeah, so nervous</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>It's O K</OL>. <F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>All right. So you are a teacher.</A>
<B><CO>Yes, I</CO>.</B>
<A>Can you tell me about your school?</A>
<B><F>Uum</F>. <F>Er</F> my school is <F>er</F> near <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>. Do you know <H pn="others1">XXX02</H> in <H pn="others2">XXX03</H> area? <?>But</?> <F>er</F> the school's name is <H pn="school name1">XXX04</H>. But this year, I have an opportunity to study English and English education in a university in <H pn="others2">XXX03</H>. So this year, I don't teach English. <F>Hm</F>. The school is very <SC>comt</SC> comfortable and <SC>students are very</SC> some students are very noisy but <F>hm</F> the atmosphere in the school is O K, I think. Not <?>a violence</?> school.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see. O K. So you're not teaching this year.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>No.</B>
<A>So can you tell me your daily life this year?</A>
<B>Yeah. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><F>Er</F> I get up <F>er</F> usual time, because <F>er</F> I have two children. <SC>So</SC> and I go to university and take some <SC>lessons</SC> lectures and study and come back.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> And take care of my children and my husband. That is my usual schedule. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>. What do you study?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> English and English education.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>Why have you decided to study in the university again?</A>
<B>Yeah. <laughter><F>Er</F> because</laughter> <F>er</F> <R>that</R> that is <F>ur</F> <?>the</?> very good question. Because <F>uum</F> when <SC>I teaching</SC> <F>er</F> I'm teaching English, <F>er</F> only I give <SC>something</SC> English something to students not to get English atmosphere or English <F>er</F> educational things. So I decided to study again, <F>er</F> put many good activities or <SC>many good information</SC> <F>uhu</F> much information and I can give them to students again. <F>Hm</F>. So I decided that.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And</OL> you mentioned you have two kids.</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Hm</F>. Students <?>are</?> junior high school students.</B>
<A><F>Err</F>. Can you tell me about them?</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Uum</F> I think when I teach them, <F>err</F> <SC>they are very</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> maybe I am a very strict teacher <nvs>laughter</nvs> and they are very good. And at first, when I changed the school before <H pn="school name1">XXX04</H>, I was teaching in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. And when I <F>er</F> changed the school <F>um</F> the students of the third graders <F>er</F> they are very <F>uum</F> <.></.> concrete <laughter>people</laughter>. It <F>er</F> is because <F>err</F> they don't want to do activity. They only <SC>sit down <F>hm</F> but</SC> <F>er</F> sat down but <F>um</F> when I went then teach and doing some activities, they are changing. <F>Hm</F>. And <F>er</F> now, <F>er</F> maybe the students of the area know <SC>about me</SC> <F>er</F> about my English style. So I think they are very <F>uum</F> good at <laughter>taking</laughter> my lesson.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F> I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><JP>Kana</JP></OL>. <F>Er</F> is it the answer of your question?</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. O K. So what do you usually do with your family on weekends?</A>
<B>Weekends. <F>Err</F> we do to the park. <F>Hm</F>. <JP>Toka</JP> <F>uum</F> and yeah, sometimes we play soccer <SC>and</SC> or we go shopping or <F>hm</F> that kind of things. <F>Er</F> <R>But</R> but my husband is very busy. He's not a teacher. <F>Er</F> I think <SC>teach</SC> some teachers are very <F>err</F> <laughter><F>uum</F> busy</laughter> because they have some club activities on Sunday. <F>Er</F> I think <SC>their hus</SC> <F>er</F> their wives <SC>don't like to</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> don't like them to do that. But <F>er</F> my husband is also very busy <F>err</F> <SC>on</SC> <SC>fro</SC> on Monday to <SC>Sa</SC> <F>er</F> Friday. <F>Er</F> <SC>he's so</SC> he has so hard job, so maybe he <R>wants</R> wants to stay in our <R>ho</R> house <F>er</F> on Saturday and Sunday. But children want to play with him because children <nvs>laughter</nvs> don't see <F>err</F> in the morning and <SC>i</SC> at night <F>er</F> <SC>fa</SC> their father. So it's not good, so I take them to out.</B>
<A>I see. O K.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>So first thing today, <OL>please look at this picture</OL>.</A>

<B>Yes. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>Please describe this picture</OL>.</A>
<B>Yeah. O K. Today is a very <F>er</F> beautiful day.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> <SC>there is <F>err</F> some hou</SC> there are some houses and a big house. In front of the house, <F>er</F> a girl is playing tag. <SC>He is</SC> <R>she is very pre</R> <F>er</F> she is very pretty and she is happy because she wants to play outside the room. <R>In</R> <R>in</R> in front of the house <F>err</F> are these boys, they are playing with the ball. And <SC>the dogs</SC> two dogs <SC>are smiling</SC> <?>what</?> or <SC>talking</SC> <F>er</F> barking. And in front of the house, there is a car and on the car roof, <F>hm</F> a cat is sleeping. <F>Err</F> She is very tired. And two women are talking about their families, maybe about their husbands or something. And one woman <SC>has</SC> <F>er</F> takes a dog. And the dog is looking at the <F>err</F> man. He is <F>er</F> sitting on a chair and reading newspaper. He wants to take much information, maybe.</B>

<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. <F>Er</F> yeah. <F>Hm</F>. About <F>um</F> neighborhood, <F>um</F> there are so many kids. So <F>err</F> they go outside, yeah, and take some games or something. But <F>um</F> in my neighborhood, <F>hm</F> we have so small area, so we don't have such kind of garden. <F>Hm</F>. So we have a big park. They go to the park. But <R>this ar</R> <F>er</F> this area people have <F>er</F> very big <F>err</F> garden. So they can play in their own garden, I think. And the same thing is <F>er</F> people like chatting <SC>in my neighborhood</SC> about my neighborhood. <F>Er</F> they want to talk about something. <F>Err</F> and this is the same, I think. And we don't take some dogs. Because <SC>this ar</SC> <F>er</F> my area is <SC>very</SC> <F>um</F> not country side.</B>

<B><OL><F>Er</F> O K</OL>. Yeah.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is thinking for a while.</ctxt>
<A><F>Um</F>. You can start.</A>
<B>O K. One day last week, I went to a very expensive restaurant with my <F>er</F> senior. <F>Hm</F>. He is my boss. And <F>er</F> <R>which restaurant is very famou</R> which restaurant is very famous. And <F>er</F> usually I can't <F>er</F> go to such kind of restaurant. <F>Um</F>. So <F>err</F> my boss <F>er</F> invited me. So I said I wanted to go. <F>Uhu</F>. And the restaurant was very expensive, you know, so he didn't <F>err</F> call. <F>Err</F> only one person to join. <F>Uhu</F>. And my boss was always <F>err</F> goes to such kind of restaurant. So he knows <F>well</F>. And <F>err</F> the day last week, <F>err</F> he took some reservation <F>hm</F> at the restaurant. And he said <F>err</F> I could order anything <F>um</F> so <R>I or</R> I ordered <F>err</F> many, many <nvs>laughter</nvs> things. And <F>err</F> <SC>I am very</SC> usually, I am very poor so I ate a lot. And <F>er</F> the dinner was so delicious that I could eat <F>er</F> much <F>er</F> more than usual. <F>Uhu</F>. And I didn't have to pay at all. So I'm very happy. My stomach <SC>i</SC> was full of <F>err</F> delicious meal. And my heart is full of something. <OL><laughter><R>You know</R> you know</laughter></OL>?</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>But maybe he was not full of money. <F>Er</F> because the restaurant was so expensive. But <SC>he was rich</SC> <R>he</R> he is rich. So it's O K.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><laughter>And</laughter></OL> <F>er</F> <R>I</R> <F>uum</F> <R>I'm su</R> I'm sure I worked harder than usual. Because when I worked harder, he can <F>err</F> invite me to go to such kind of restaurant, I think. So we <F>err</F> said good-bye. And I was very happy. O K?</B>
<A>Thank you. <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>

<B><F>Uum</F>. Yes. <OL>Sometimes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>What do you think of that kind of communication with other teachers or colleagues?</A>
<B><F>Uum</F>. It's a very good for us to be relaxed or one thing is to talk about something for me about the school or about the students. So he or she <F>er</F> can help me and I can help them. And one is <F>err</F> outside of the school, <SC>we</SC> <F>er</F> I think, we have to <F>uum</F> take attention to other things not only the working things, students <?>about</?> or school. But also, we have to think about another kind of things. So <F>uum</F> I think <F>uum</F> outside, we can get much information <SC>to</SC> <F>er</F> we can use in school,</B>
<A><F>Uum</F>.</A>
<B>or lessons. And <F>er</F> main point is to be relaxed.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>That is very important for me. And we have such energy. We can do <OL><laughter>another thing, I think</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>. I see. O K. So a lots of <OL>energy</OL>.</A>

<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
