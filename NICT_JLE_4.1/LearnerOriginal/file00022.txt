<followup>
<A>O K. Thank you very much. <F>Er</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, do you have a computer?</A>
<B>Yes, I have.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <R>What</R> what do you do with it?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> when I use <SC>a com</SC> my computer, I usually use <F>uh</F> word processor software. It is called Word. <F>Um</F> <R>using</R> <F>er</F> using a soft, Word, I sometimes make some documents or some, <?>you know</?> teaching materials</B>

<A>O K. <F>Uh</F> do you think <F>hm</F> a computer will make our life happier?</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>happier. <F>Um</F> you know, in my opinion, using computer is very <SC>convenient and <F>erm</F> yeah, <?>ma</?></SC> <F>um</F> convenient because when we want to write a letter, <F>uh</F> like sending a e-mail or sending a greeting card <F>um</F> <.></.> <R>we can</R> we can write a letter or <SC>the</SC> a message quickly without any paper or a pen.

<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And so it is very convenient and then <F>um</F> my friends or <R>oth</R> other people who <?>want to be accept</?> <F>um</F> gets my e-mail or letter, greeting cards quickly. So <R>I often</R> I often send many messages to many friends. So probably my <F>er</F> relationship <F>uh</F> with my friends are <F>mmm</F> <F>erm</F> yeah, getting broadened.</B>

<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But when I went back <R>to my</R> <F>uh</F> to my <F>er</F> house and I tried on that sweater, <R>I don't</R> I don't like the color. So may I ask you to change <F>uh</F> this one to <SC>the</SC> another color?</B>
<A><F>Um</F> I'm sorry. This is against our policy.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> really? <F>Um</F> <F>well</F> <SC>I</SC> <F>er</F> <F>oh</F> O K. When I <F>er</F> came to this shop to buy this sweater, <SC>I had</SC> I asked another clerk to find <.></.> <F>um</F> <R>the</R> the red one,</B>

<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I didn't have any choice <R>to</R> <F>um</F> to buy a red sweater. So that's why I bought a yellow sweater, this one. <SC>So</SC> <F>um</F> but I can find a red sweater over there on the shelf, so may I check the size of that sweater? If it says M, <F>uh</F> <R>I</R> I think I have a right to get that one because <F>um</F> I wanted to buy a red sweater at first.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> but that sweater came this morning and <F>er</F> I think it's a little different from <F>mm</F> yours.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> really? <F>Mmm</F> but <F>um</F> <..></..> I tried it just once so I didn't make it dirty. <SC>And so</SC> and <SC>that sign says</SC> <F>eh</F> the sign of the red sweater says <F>uh</F> five thousand yen and I bought this one <F>er</F> <SC>six thou</SC> <F>ah</F> in six thousand yen.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I'm O K <R>if you</R> <F>um</F> if you give me a red sweater with <R>no</R> no extra money. <F>Ah</F> I mean <SC>I can</SC> I'm O K if you don't get me one thousand yen and a red sweater if you get me a <OL>red sweater</OL>.</B>

<B><F>Ah</F> <F>erm</F> I beg your pardon? <OL><??></??></OL></B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL> This is one thousand yen, so less than that. But <F>er</F> I can't give you another one thousand yen. Is that all right? Just a exchange?</A>
<B><CO>So you mean I have to add one thousand yen <OL>if I want to get</OL></CO>.</B>
<A><OL>No, no</OL>. This is cheaper. <F>Ah</F></A>
<B><CO><OL>But I</OL></CO>.</B>
<A><OL>but</OL> you can't get your one thousand back.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> O K.</B>
