<B><F>Erm</F> <F>well</F>I can't say in openly but <F>em</F> <SC>that's</SC> the <SC>a</SC> incident is good for us. Because the <F>er</F> consumers' perception against Snow is getting lower now.

And also <F>er</F> we are announcing on the <SC>P O</SC> <SC>post</SC> point of purchase, P O P <F>em</F> on the shelf or that kind of thing.</B>
<A><CO><F>Wow</F> <OL>so</OL></CO>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> <F>er</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I think <F>well</F></SC> the wind <F>well</F> is blowing for us.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> that's good.</A>
<B><F>Umm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. And by the way, where are you from <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. I'm originally from Fukuoka, Kyushu area.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. Then, when did you come up to Tokyo?</A>
<B><F>Em</F>. When I was a university student, I came to Yokohama. And I stayed in there and, <F>well</F> once I tried to <R>co</R> come back to <SC>home</SC> <R>my</R> my home country. <F>Well</F> that's why I joined this company. And actually, I used to work in another company in Tokyo area. And I joined to Uni Leva, saying I'd like go back to home country, <SC>so</SC> <F>er</F> as a sales. Then, I move back to home country, working at the sales. But <F>well</F> somehow, I came back here and working now in Tokyo.</B>
<A>O K. So you moved many places <F>er</F> <OL>many times</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yes, a lot</OL>. <OL>Yes, a lot</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. So which place was the best for you?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> the best place was in New Zealand.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> actually, I moved from Fukuoka to Kagoshima and U. K. for <R>le</R> learning English over there for six months. And moved back to Tokyo and sent to New Zealand.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>.</A>
<B>And came back to Yokohama, Utsunomiya and,</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>now I'm living</OL> in Saitama.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. But why do you like New Zealand best?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> the very good atmosphere for family. And also <SC>the</SC> I like natures. I mean that's why I wanted to come back to my home country Fukuoka. Because <F>well</F> <SC>very nice</SC> <F>well</F> how could I say, Fukuoka is the <SC>very nice c</SC> <F>well</F> very <F>ah</F> <F>em</F> cosmopolitan area. <F>Well</F> central Fukuoka is <F>well</F> business city. But <SC>outside</SC> how could I say, <F>um</F> surrounding of the <F>er</F> cities, <F>well</F> we could see <SC>a lots of natu</SC> lots of nature remains <F>er</F> still. So <F>er</F> I prefer that kind of situation. And New Zealand is exactly <F>erm</F> <F>erm</F> <R>what I</R> <R>what I wa</R> what I want to <?>live</?>. So <F>er</F> <R>very nice</R> very nice ocean views and mountainsides <SC>and</SC> but still, <F>em</F> how could they say, <F>em</F> <F>well</F> for business, <R>they are</R> they are working <R>proper</R> proper business over there. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. I see. Sounds great. O K. Thank you.</A>

<task>
<A>Now,</A>
<B><nvs>sniff</nvs></B>
<A>I'd like to show <?>you</?> a picture. Here.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Please describe this picture for me.</A>
<B>Right. <F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> maybe <F>er</F> this is <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the lady's <SC>room</SC> <F>erm</F> <SC>private room</SC> bedroom. So <F>er</F> <SC>she has</SC> yes, <R>the</R> <F>well</F> <R>there</R> <SC>there wa</SC> there is <SC>be</SC> <SC>wa</SC> a bed and computer, typewriter and stereos. And also, she seems like <F>em</F>like pets. <SC>There i</SC> there are dog and cat. <.></.> And more?</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>sniff</nvs></B>
<A>So <R>she</R> she is having a pet inside the house.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. Do you like to do that?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> no, <F>well</F> to be honest, I don't like it.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL>Why not</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Mm</F></OL>. <F>Well</F> maybe because of my <F>erm</F> backgrounds. Because <R>in</R> <F>well</F> <F>erm</F> in a country area <F>well</F> in Japan, <F>well</F> many people have a pet in outside of the <F>er</F> house. And also, I did the same thing, I mean, always my parents said, <F>well</F> "Don't take pet into the room.".</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And I didn't do it. So <F>er</F> I still I believe <F>well</F> the pet <R>should</R> should live in outside of the house.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I mean, that's the a pet's life.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Em</F> <SC>that's why I think</SC> and also <SC>that is not good for ma</SC> <SC>fo</SC> <F>mm</F> <F>em</F> the hair of the <F>er</F> pets is <OL>not</OL>,</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>good for health. That is <?>by heart</?>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>er</F> if I think about my kids,</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>well</F></OL> kids always want to have a pet but I'm now living in <F>em</F> small apartment house. So if we have a pet, we have to put the pet into house.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But I don't want <R>ki</R> kids play around the pet <R>in the</R> in the room.</B>
<A>I see. But <F>er</F> still in Japan, <OL>many people</OL> try to keep them,</A>
<B><OL><F>Mmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>inside the <OL>house</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>But <F>er</F> why do they do that?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <nvs>sniff</nvs> <R>may</R> maybe because they think <F>em</F> <SC>the pet is not the o</SC> <R>pe</R> pet is not any more pet. I mean, pet is the <F>er</F> like <SC>a child</SC> their child. <F>Mm</F> maybe that's why. <F>Mmm</F>. But <SC>I think</SC> <R>when I</R> when I think from the side of pet,</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><R>I don't know</R> <?>yeah</?> I don't know because <SC>I can con</SC> I cannot have a conversation with them. But maybe pets wants to live outside, I mean, nature. <F>Oh</F> that's my <laughter>thinking</laughter>.</B>
<A>So you are sorry for <OL><laughter>pets</laughter></OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F></OL>. Honest speaking, yes.</B>
<A>O K. And <F>er</F> <R>s</R> so you said you live in a apartment.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>But <F>er</F> please tell me about your room.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>.</B>
<A>What do you do in your room?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <F>well</F> <SC>fir</SC> <F>well</F> before I start the explaining my room,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Em</F> maybe it's better to explain my family.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Because there are two kids. And the elder daughter is <F>ei</F> ten years old. And younger son is six years old. So they are quite <.></.> <R>bi</R> big now. And <R>n</R> now, they are sharing the room. But both of them started say "I'd like to have a room." and "I'd like a room.". So <F>er</F> I'm living in a three <F>er</F> so-called <SC>three</SC> <F>em</F> <JP><SC>san e</SC></JP> three L D K, three bedrooms and living room. <F>Erm</F> in total, seventy-four square meters. So <F>er</F> not quite big. So <F>er</F> two kids are sharing one room. And <SC>one i</SC> one room is for almost storage. There is the <F>er</F> <R>bookshelv</R> <F>er</F> bookshelves and also clothing <F>em</F> cabinet.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And that kind of things. And in the living room, <F>em</F> there is the <SC>P C</SC> computer. <F>Well</F> it's that the same thing. And stereo, T V and one other left room is the <F>er</F> for <?>our</?> bedroom.</B>

<B><F>Well</F> because the always school teacher was very arrogant. And when I was <F>em</F> <R>when I</R> when I took the <F>er</F> a silence, I was <F>erm</F> very young. And so <F>er</F> when I went there, <F>em</F> I couldn't <SC>stand</SC> endure their arroganceness. And I didn't go to the school. That's why it took two years.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. But minimum is two month.</B>
<A>I see. Then, if you go to school, you can automatically get a license?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> of course, you need a little bit of efforts to do <OL>it</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>But <F>em</F> <F>well</F> it's not so difficult to do it.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> of course, you have to pass the exam.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I mean, reading and also <F>er</F> driving technique. But <F>em</F> if you go there, I mean, <SC>school teacher is not</SC> <F>well</F> how could I say, <F>er</F> <SC>school</SC> <F>well</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I think the</SC> <F>well</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I remember the figures but I think ninety percent of people <F>erm</F> got their license if they go to <R>s</R> <F>erm</F> schools.</B>
<A>O K. Then, <R>what</R> what do you think of the Japan's traffic situation?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> it's very heavy. <SC>I'm always <F>em</F></SC> even in Omiya. <F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> but that's also <SC>very difficult points</SC> <R>very contradict</R> contradictional points. Because <F>er</F> for family, I'd like to drive. But at the same time, I know it cause of the <F>er</F> traffic jams.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>er</F> <SC>I</SC> <SC>when I</SC> <F>well</F> if I go to Omiya <SC>City</SC> <R>ce</R> center of city <SC>I should</SC> I think I should take a train rather than driving a car. But if I'm think about family, <laughter>always I <SC>drive</SC></laughter> driving. That's my problem.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><CO>But</CO>.</B>
<A>Sorry to go back to this picture.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>But <F>erm</F> what could they have done to avoid the kind of traffic accident?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> first of all, I mean, <SC>I</SC> <F>well</F> from my point of view, I mean, <SC>this</SC> <F>erm</F> <SC>my</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> rider, I think that rider's fault. <SC>Be</SC> <F>well</F> if he is not so concentrate to talking through mobile phone, then, <F>well</F> they could escape this accident I think.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. So if your son <F>er</F> said he wants to have a motorbike license,</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F></B>
<A>what would you say?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <.></.> <R>I</R> I used to have the motorbike.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And I gave up. Because <F>em</F> <F>well</F> <SC>my bo</SC> <F>well</F> someone always <F>er</F> broke something, I mean, at night. <F>Well</F> maybe <F>well</F> high school students or someone I didn't know. But <F>em</F> because very expensive to fix. That's why I gave up. But if my son said, <F>well</F> he is love to ride a bike, I would say O K. <R>Because</R> because <R>I</R> I loved it.</B>
