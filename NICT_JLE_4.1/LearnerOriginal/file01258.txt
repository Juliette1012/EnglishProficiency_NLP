<B><F>Urm</F> avoiding</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> avoiding <OL><F>ur</F></OL></A>
<B><OL>like</OL> breaking <OL>a promise</OL>?</B>
<A><OL>breaking a</OL> promise.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> I try not to <F>er</F> break a promise at all. And <F>ur</F> <SC>if I have to, I think it's just really</SC> <F>uh</F> if I have to break a promise, it's really a serious problem.</B>
<A>That's right.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>So it's unavoidable sometimes.</A>
<B>Sometimes it's <F>uh</F> unavoidable, but I don't think it's good to break a promise because you'll make the other person not trust you as much as they used to. And that breaks their friendship <OL>and</OL></B>
<A><OL>That's</OL> right.</A>
<B>trustworthiness. <OL><CO>And</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>. What kind of factors are necessary when you trust somebody?</A>
<B>When you trust somebody, you need to know the person for sure.</B>

<B>You need to spend a lot of time with them, I think. And to trust a person, I think you should know the family, too.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. That's <OL>right</OL>.</A>
