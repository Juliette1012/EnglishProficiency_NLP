<B><F>Erm</F>. Of course. Sure.</B>
<A>How are you today, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B><F>Hum</F>. I have a little bit cold, so I have a stomachache. So I wonder I could come here today or not because it was snowing in the morning. And you know that my home is in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. It takes more than two hours to come here and have to change trains three times. So I wonder I really could come here or not today. But I'm really happy to come here and have a test today.</B>
<A>Thank you very <OL>much for coming</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><laughter><F>Mm-hmm</F></laughter></OL>.</B>
<A>Do you do anything special to recover your cold?</A>
<B>Nothing in special. But <R>I</R> <F>er</F> I drunk <SC>ginger</SC> hot ginger. What shall I say? Hot ginger or something like that. Yeah. To put honey and ginger. It makes me warm.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. I see. Do you like cold weather?</A>
<B>I don't like. Even though I like skiing, I don't like cold weather. Because I am easy to catch cold, and I have to worry about my children. Yeah. And my daughter is really easy to catch cold. <OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Erm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>My son, <F>hum</F> he is O K. But</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>hum</F> my daughter is not <laughter>O K</laughter>.</B>
<A>Right. <F>Well</F>. Could you tell me about one of your ski trip?</A>
<B>Ski trip? Yeah, yeah. <SC>We haven't <F>mhm</F> got</SC> we haven't been to ski with my family because my son is already good at skiing. <laughter><SC>And</SC></laughter> so she must be worried about me, because I'm not good at skiing. But, in my younger days, I used to go skiing with my husband. At that time, he was not my husband at all, but I had a <F>mm</F> lot of great time with him. <OL><F>Um-hum</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.</A>
<B>We used to go <F>mm</F> <R>Shiga</R> <F>ah</F> Shiga Kogen, because both of us <SC>come from</SC> originally come from Osaka.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> <F>wow</F>.</A>
<B>So I heard <SC>that</SC> from my friend that many people living in Kanto area go to Zaou, Tohoku area. But, <SC>in</SC> <F>uh</F> people living in Osaka or Kansai area, <F>hum</F> maybe, I think, go to Shiga Kogen, Nagano Prefecture. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. Why is that?</A>
<B>Because it is near <SC>from Osaka area</SC> from Kansai area.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. What's Shiga Kogen like? <OL><CO>I haven't been to</CO></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. Really? <F>Em</F>. It was really nice. There are a lot of cute houses. <F>Mhm</F>. They sell fancy goods. So, when you are young, you real like <SC>fancy goods</SC> <F>mhm</F> so many cute sweatshirts or fancy goods. So <R>I used to</R> <F>em</F> I used to buy some fancy good when I was young. And now, my daughter, ten years old, has a <R>sa</R> same kind of <R>hobby</R> hobby or taste. <F>Mmm</F>.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL> <F>well</F>. Could you compare living in Osaka <F>erm</F> to living in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. The most <F>mm</F> clear thing is the taste of food. <F>Erm</F>. Especially, <JP>udon</JP>. So <.></.> <F>erm</F> the color of the soup is different. <R>Our</R> <SC>our</SC> <F>oh</F> I'm not sure, I should call that our <laughter>or something</laughter> like that. But <F>em</F> <JP><R>o</R> <.></.> oudon</JP>, <SC>in Osaka</SC> you can eat in Osaka very <F>mhm</F> what shall I say, clear color.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. Compared with <JP>udon</JP> in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. <SC>You can s</SC> <F>ah</F> first time I saw <JP>udon</JP> in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>, it was like <laughter>coffee and <JP>udon</JP></laughter>. So the color is very thick. Yeah. Very strong. And the taste is not <R>so</R> <F>mhm</F> so good for us. <OL><R>So</R></OL></B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B>So <SC>I wonder why</SC> <F>er</F> I wonder what they eat when <.></.> people in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>, they have cold. <F>Mm</F>. When we have cold, we eat <JP>udon</JP>, but we can't find any <JP>udon</JP> store in Kanto area. <F>Mmm</F>. <SC>So</SC> but one of my friend told me when they have cold, they eat <JP>udon</JP> or <JP>okayu</JP>.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>Yeah. We tend to take <JP>udon</JP> a lot more, instead of <JP>okayu</JP>.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. O K. <F>Hum</F>. So, how do your children like living in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>?</A>
<B>Yeah. Maybe, I think, the same. But children in Osaka <SC>is much more</SC> <F>uh</F> are much more interesting, compared with the one in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> area. <nvs>coughs</nvs> <F>Uh</F>. Excuse me. <nvs>coughs</nvs> So my son and my daughter can understand what my husband and I are talking in Osaka dialect. But they can't repeat in a right intonation and right rhythm. So, <SC>they</SC> when they try to speak in Osaka dialect, for them, Osaka dialect is not <F>eh</F> Japanese, but some kind of foreign language. They really try to imitate.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>. Yeah.</B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. Thank you. <F>Erm</F>. First thing, <F>hum</F> I'd like you to describe this picture for me.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>. A women is trying to tell the dog and the cat how to use computer. But they don't have any interest in them. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So, maybe, she doesn't have any child. So that this dog and this cat is, for her, <SC>like their</SC> like her children. So <SC>she spend</SC> she spends a lot of time with them. And these two animals <SC>are</SC> <F>er</F> have good relationship each other. Maybe, the dog <SC>come</SC> came this home earlier than this cat. <SC>And</SC> <R>but</R> <.></.> <F>mm</F> <R>but she</R> <F>mm</F> <SC>but she re</SC> but I think she likes this cat a lot more. Because <F>mm</F> dog is really loyal to any other human beings. On the other hand, cat is not. <SC>So</SC> but, <R>for women, they have</R> for women, they have a tendency to take care of the one who doesn't have any interests <R>for</R> <.></.> for her. But they have a very good atmosphere. And she must have a job at home. And, even though she is really busy, <SC>she really</SC> <SC>she is really happy to be</SC> she is really happy with them.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Hum</F>. O K. Thank you <OL>very much</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</B>
<A>Why did you think this dog came earlier than this <.></.> cat to this house?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. <R>Because</R> <F>em</F> because <SC>I heard that</SC> I never taken care of any animals because I have an allergy. But one of my friend told me that it is easier to take care of dog, <F>urm</F> compared with the cat. So, once she is used to tame one animal, she tries to tame another kind. So that I think dog comes first.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. <.></.> <R>So</R> <F>erm</F> <.></.> so you mentioned you have the allergy.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. <R>What</R> what the <F>err</F> <.></.> <OL><??></??> is like</OL></A>
<B><OL>Maybe, skin allergy</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>symptoms you have</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Hum</F> <F>oh</F></OL>. Itches, and I can't wear my wedding bands, because metallic allergy. So my husband wears wedding bands, though I don't. So it's a really strange thing. Because so many women <F>em</F> try to wear wedding bands, but <SC>husband doesn't want to</SC> <F>ah</F> <R>husband</R> <F>ah</F> husband <SC>don't want to try</SC> don't want to wear them, <F>hum</F> maybe. But, in my case, he wears, but I don't wear.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. I see.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.</B>

<B><F>Ah</F>. One day last week, <SC>I'm go</SC> <SC>I'm</SC> I went to a department store to buy a nice necktie for my husband's birthday. And <SC>it takes a lot</SC> it takes a long time to decide <SC>which necktie is</SC> <F>er</F> which tie is suitable for my husband. So I ask some of the sales representative which one is the best.

And they were for sale. Thirty-percent discount. So I was wondering I could buy or not. Luckily, I have my <F>ee</F> credit card, so I think I could use it. And I bought one pair of good <F>er</F> shoes. And, after that, on the right corner, I saw another good thing. That was clothes. That was so beautiful and nice. It would be very nice if <SC>wa</SC> <R>match</R> <R>match the</R> match the shoes I've already bought. So the color is nice, very suitable for spring. So I decided to buy both skirt and blouse. And I <.></.> went on buying, <laughter>buying</laughter>, buying. And, at last, I bought many things. So I didn't think when I <.></.> just went into the department store. But I'm <R>rea</R> really happy, and my husband will be very happy <.></.> <F>mm</F> if I wear beautiful clothes suitable <SC>for the</SC> for his tie.</B>
