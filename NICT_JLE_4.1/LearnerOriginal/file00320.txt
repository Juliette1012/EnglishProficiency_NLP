<stage2>
<task>
<A>Let's try a first picture today.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>And this one.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>.</B>
<A>Could you describe this picture for me?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Em</F> this is a room. And there is a lady sitting on her chair. And there are <SC>two animals</SC> two pets. One is dog, and one is cat. And <F>er</F> I think she was doing computer. And there is a <F>er</F> typewriter there, and a dust box and a bed. And the door is open. And <F>er</F> there is a audio set, and a calendar and a clock. And more? <F>Ah</F> <F>ah</F> and <R>she</R> she is wearing green sweater. And <SC>she is kind of</SC> she looks like explaining about computer to her pets. But pets are not listening to <laughter>her</laughter>. They're just sleeping. <OL><??></??></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. Thank you.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Em</F> do you like this kind of room?</A>
<B>Yes. Because there is a computer which I don't have.</B>
<A>O K. What would you like to use the computer for?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC>I like</SC> I want to do the Internet. I want to do like E-mails <?>and stuff</?>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Mhm-hum</F>. <F>Eh</F> do you actually use E-mail <OL>nowadays</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL> with <F>eh</F> my cell phone.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>But not with the computer.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Why do you think <F>er</F> people like to use the E-mail so much?</A>
<B>Because it's easy to communicate. <SC>I can like</SC> if I write a letter to my foreign friend, it takes like more than a week. But with an E-mail, <SC>it's just like</SC> you know, just it's a moment. It's more convenient and fast.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Could you compare this room with your own room?</A>
<B>Yes. My room is much smaller than this room. And <F>er</F> as I said before, I don't have computer. I don't have typewriter. I do have pets. I have three cats and two dogs. So that's maybe the point I'm better than her. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And I do have audio set. And <F>er</F> other than that, pretty much same.</B>

<B>I know <SC>I'll</SC> I really wanted to call. But actually, my mom was taken to the hospital with ambulance. And <F>er</F> it was like I didn't have time because I was so upset. So I should have thought about calling you. But I was kind of upset. So upset so I couldn't make it.</B>
<A>I understand. <F>Well</F> <R>I</R> I want to tell those friends of yours what happens.</A>
