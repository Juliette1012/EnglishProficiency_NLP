</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Er</F>. Have you ever been abroad?</A>
<B><.></.> Yes. <F>Mmm</F>. As I say, <SC>so</SC> I went to the U K and visit there five months. And then <.></.> went to Thailand. And <SC>be</SC> <R>I've been</R> I've been there for seven months.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>. But did you take a train,</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. <OL><F>Well</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>there</OL>?</A>
<B>When I was in the U K, I took <SC>several time</SC> several times.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But not in Thailand.</B>
<A>I see. And what is the difference between <F>er</F> <R>the</R> the <SC>i</SC> British train and Japanese train?</A>
<B><F>Well</F>. British train <nvs>laughter</nvs> is <F>er</F> <.></.> not punctual. So <F>mm</F> when I see <SC>the</SC> their brochure, <R>th</R> they are proud of the punctuality. So it says <F>er</F> <SC>the</SC> I can't remember the exact number. But the eighty percent of their train <R>s</R> <F>er</F> starts within <.></.> ten minutes <.></.> <F>er</F> on the punctual time.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>So normally in Japan, so <F>mm</F> it should <?>be this</?> punctual. But the <R>ei</R> eighty percent isn't so high. And also they says that within the <F>er</F> ten minutes or <F>er</F> something. So I can't <R>beli</R> believe it <SC?>then</SC?> <F>mm</F> when I <F>uh</F> first <SC>see</SC> saw it.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. So did you have any trouble with the delay?</A>
<B>Delay train? <F>Oh</F> yes, I did. And sometime it easily cancels. I say easily cancelled the trains <F>er</F> are the big problem with it. When <SC>I</SC> <F>ah</F> <SC>so</SC> I was in Sheffield, it was two hours <R>from</R> <F>er</F> from London. <F>Erm</F>. <F>Uh</F> and normally, <R>I</R> I take a reserved seat. But the train was cancelled. <R>And</R> and no information about it. <R>I</R> <SC>I can</SC> I just can't see my train. And I <F>em</F> look around and <F>mm</F> catch <F>er</F> station worker. And I asked, "Where is my train?". "No, just cancelled.". "So what should I do?".</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. <F>Mm</F>. "<R>J</R> just ask the at the office or <laughter>something</laughter>.". And I went there. <SC>And</SC> so "No, sorry. Just <laughter>cancelled</laughter>.". So <R>I</R> I look for the next train. But the next problem is there is the information of the next train. But before that, <SC>there is</SC> <F>er</F> how can I say, <F>er</F> it's not a normal train. But they <.></.> use <F>er</F> additional train for, I am not sure, so it's <F>er</F> extra for the cancel train or not. But there <R>w</R> was another one.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But no information <.></.> again.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>So I missed it. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And I had an, yeah, <.></.> appointment with friends <F>er</F> at that time. But I <.></.> can't,</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>join it. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
