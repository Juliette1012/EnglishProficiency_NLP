<A>O K. Good evening.</A>
<B>Good evening.</B>
<A>My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have yours?</A>
<B>Yes. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>O K. Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Yes. Please call me <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>Thank you. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, what do you usually do around this time?</A>
<B>Around this time? Usually, I work,</B>
<A>Still?</A>
<B><R>at</R> <R>at my</R> at my <F>err</F> office.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. What do you do as your job?</A>
<B><F>Urrr</F>. <SC>I am</SC> <F>ur</F> I'm running some companies.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>. <OL>Companies</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>I am</OL> <laughter>companies</laughter> companies.</B>
<A><F>Urrr</F>.</A>
<B>Yes. Several companies.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see. So you are in charge of these all companies to supervise?</A>
<B>Yes. That's right.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>. What are the difficulties to have more than one company at one time?</A>
<B><F>Urrr</F>. One time. That's very difficult because many division <F>ur</F> are different <F>urr</F> system, and the different way, and different person, and everything are different. <F>Urr</F> I mean, for example, <F>mm</F> my company has <F>urr</F> just logistic company. And <F>urr</F> also transportation company. <R>And</R> and <F>urr</F> ceremony center, <R>swimming</R> swimming school. That's <F>urr</F> so complete different. So, sometimes very difficult, but I enjoy work very much.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see. O K. <F>Urm</F>. Tell me is there any difficulties as a woman enterplaner?</A>
<B><F>Urrr</F>. I see. <F>Urr</F>. <SC>some of</SC> only some of people are little different to treat me or <SC>man</SC> another man. <F>Err</F> like <F>urr</F> even I'm a top, even though, <F>urr</F> <SC>first of all</SC> first guest, like <F>ur</F> <.></.> <F>mm</F> before maybe we met each other, but that person usually never forget to me because I'm a woman.</B>
<A>That's an advantage.</A>
<B>Yeah, but <F>urr</F> <F>mmm</F> sometimes, <F>urr</F> first time, <F>ur</F> guest, <F>urr</F> "<F>Oh</F> I'd like to meet your boss.". That's, <laughter>I'm <F>ur</F> like a secretary</laughter>, you know. Yeah, and <F>uh</F> "I am", I said, and "What?". <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Ohh</F>. <F>Wow</F>. That's too bad.</A>
<B>So little different, like <F>urr</F> compare to Japan and United States, I think. But recently, not so bad.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see. <R>I</R> I'm glad to hear that.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>O K. Since you are having so much companies or <.></.> <R>enter</R> <SC>enter</SC> enterprising, so maybe you have little time to <nvs>laughter</nvs> spare for <OL>your hobbies</OL> or</A>
<B><OL>Not at all</OL>. Not, not at all.</B>
<A>Not at all?</A>
<B><F>Urrr</F>. Since last year, <F>mm</F> <SC>I became</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>no, no</SC> I move to the swimming pool. And mainly, I stay in swimming pool's office.</B>
<A><F>Urr</F>. So how do you release your stress?</A>
<B><F>Uh</F>. <F>Mm</F>. One of my hobbies are work. And another, <nvs>laughter</nvs> of course, <F>urr</F> I like dancing, <SC>go</SC> <SC>going</SC> <F>um</F> go to <R>shop</R> shopping, and <F>urr</F> maybe things like <F>urr</F> <F>urr</F> go to see opera or ballet. <F>Err</F>. But usually, I enjoyed work very much, so no problem.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>Work is the best <nvs>laughter</nvs> for me, <SC>my</SC> one of my hobbies.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>. How many hours do you sleep?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. Usually, <R>four</R> <R>four</R> four hours.</B>
<A>Is that enough for you?</A>
<B>I don't think so. But I don't have enough time. So no choice.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>Even in the dream, <F>urr</F> sometimes <R>work</R> <R>work</R> work, here. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A><F>Wow</F>. <F>Mmm</F>. O K. Thank you. O K. I'm going to show you a picture.</A>
<B><F>Mm-hmm</F>.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewer is taking out the picture.</ctxt>
<A>Will you describe this picture for me?</A>
<B>O K. <F>Urr</F> I think <F>urr</F> this is a school, and <F>urr</F> the teacher <F>urr</F> teaching the students <F>mm</F> for <F>uh</F> mathematics. And most of people are not interested in that <R>math</R> math lesson. So <F>urr</F> one of men, <.></.> <F>urr</F> I don't know how to say in English, but <F>urr</F> <SC>I</SC> <F>ur</F> the man is drinking <F>urr</F> <SC>juice</SC> a bottle of juice. And <F>ur</F> another lady <F>err</F> is <F>ur</F> playing <F>ur</F> <R>calu</R> caluculator, I think. And <F>ur</F> two of students are chatting each other. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Only one person <R>who</R> who has yellow hair <F>mm</F> he just a <F>urr</F> maybe <R>he is</R> he is trying to concentrate. <F>Err</F>. But I think he can't. And I don't know how to say in, to make up <F>urr</F> <R>buble</R> <SC>bubble gum</SC> <JP>kana</JP> gum? <F>Mm</F>. Yeah. But <F>urr</F> <SC>teacher <F>ur</F> is <SC>s</SC> no</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> teacher is continuing to teach math <F>ur</F> to use <F>ur</F> black board.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Mm</F> O K. Thank you. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> <JP>san</JP></A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>Can you compare this class room to your class room when you were, let's say, high school student?</A>
<B><F>Uh</F>. High school student. <F>Urr</F>. When <SC>I am</SC> <F>urr</F> <R>I was</R> I was a high school student, <F>urm</F> teacher <SC>is</SC> was so strict. And nobody <F>err</F> like that action. <F>Mm</F>. I think recently, in many schools' teacher and also student are <.></.> not so good because the teacher also doesn't want to study so much, just same teaching. And <F>urr</F> also the student <R>are</R> are not concentrate to study <F>err</F> because most of people has a cellular phone, and <SC>on</SC> always <F>urr</F> on and <F>urr</F> usually <F>err</F> talking <F>mm</F> with <F>urr</F> cellular phone. That's why the teacher also can't <F>er</F> concentrate to teach to them. So I can't believe that situation.</B>
