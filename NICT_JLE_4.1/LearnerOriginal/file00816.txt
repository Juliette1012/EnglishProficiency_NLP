<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>But <F>er</F></OL> I thought I should really take <F>um</F> a spoken test <SC>just</SC> <F>uh</F> partly because <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> I <F>er</F> didn't do well in a <R>interview s</R> interview session. <R>I</R> <F>er</F> <SC>I was</SC> <R>I'm</R> I'm looking for job and then <SC>I like to</SC> <F>er</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I take</SC> they <F>er</F> chose me <F>um</F> as one of the candidates, but <F>er</F> I think <SC>I don't</SC> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I was not chosen because my <F>er</F> spoken skill was so low compared with other candidates so <F>er</F> I thought <SC?>I</SC?> this is a great opportunity for me to <R>practice</R></B>

So strange cat. Anyway <R>so they</R> so <SC>they</SC> <F>um</F> some of them decided to stay. <laughter>So that's how <SC>I got to</SC> I got those</laughter> cats, but <F>uh</F> <R>the</R> they're at my mother's. <R>I</R> I live alone in my apartment, <R>so</R> <F>um</F> <laughter><SC>so this</SC></laughter> <SC>I</SC> you know, like when I see my mother, I can see those cats as well.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><laughter>Right</laughter>.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>. Thank you.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A><F>Uum</F> first thing today,</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>I'm going to show you a picture. O K. So could you describe this picture?</A>
<B>I suppose this is a classroom situation. And <F>er</F> <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>these age group</SC> <F>oh</F> <SC>there's</SC> <SC>their</SC> <R>the</R> their age group vary. <F>Er</F> some of them are probably <F>oh</F> in their thirties and some of them are <F>um</F> in their late teens. So <?>th</?> <SC>there</SC> this is like <F>er</F> <.></.> high school <F>er</F> where <R>the</R> <SC>the</SC> high school <SC>s</SC> <F>uum</F> dropouts can <F>um</F> start studying again to get their high school diplomas, I guess. <OL><CO>I just</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> teachers looks nervous.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Actually</OL> <R>she remains me of</R> she reminds me of <laughter>myself right now</laughter>.</B>
<A>Really?</A>
<B><laughter><CO>Or</CO></laughter>. Yeah. <?>As <F>er</F></?> gets nervous and <F>er</F> students are not really interested in <F>er</F> studying English. And <F>er</F> they remind me of my students. <laughter><CO>So like</CO></laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. O K. Yeah. Thank you very much.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Then, what do you think about these students' attitude?</A>
<B><.></.> <F>Well</F> <R>they</R> <F>um</F> <.></.> <SC>they arn</SC> <R>they</R> <SC>they are apprehens</SC> <?><F>well</F></?> they don't wanna study anything and then <SC>but <F>er</F> I suppose that</SC> <F>er</F> yeah, I don't know. Just <F>um</F> I don't want to be too judgmental but <F>er</F> if this teacher is more interesting or more motivating, they may be interested in studying. <SC>If</SC> I mean, and then also if she is more student-centered or whatever, because <SC>that</SC> <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> it seems like, to me, <SC>they're</SC> <SC>they</SC> I mean, <R>they</R> <SC>they</SC> I don't know really what's going on but, <F>er</F> <R>they</R> <R>they</R> they decided to study again.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>um</F> I cannot really blame students too much and teachers are responsible for their motivations as well.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. Then, how do you manage your class if your students are like this?</A>
<B><laughter>I don't know</laughter>. <.></.> <F>Um</F> <R>I</R> I think, the <F>er</F> first of all, that the material should be <F>er</F> more interesting. <R>And the</R> <SC>and the also the</SC> <F>er</F> <nvs>tsk</nvs> <F>well</F> I don't know. <F>Um</F> <.></.> <F>uum</F>. <nvs>tsk</nvs> It's a good question. <laughter>I never thought of</laughter> how I would manage this class. <F>Uum</F>. <.></.> Yeah, <??></??> the material should be <F>um</F> something that <F>er</F> they can learn without too much problems. And the materials should be related to the daily <F>well</F> situations. <SC?>In a s</SC?> <R?>I</R?> I'm not saying <R>every s</R> every single thing that <F>uh</F> she teaches should be <F>er</F> <R>that the</R> <.></.> <SC>that the</SC> <F>um</F> <F>um</F> related to the daily life, but <R>some of them</R> <SC>some of them</SC> some should be <F>er</F> something that <F>er</F> they can relate themselves to very well. <F>Mm</F>. But <SC>the</SC> I really like this picture because <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> lot of times <SC>that</SC> <F>uh</F> <R>in</R> in a Japanese <F>um</F> <R>ma</R> <R>ma</R> <F>er</F> materials, <SC>that</SC> the teachers all has to be always men, but <SC>this is</SC> <R>this</R> this happen to be a woman.</B>
<A>O K. Yeah.</A>
<B><?>Right</?>.</B>
