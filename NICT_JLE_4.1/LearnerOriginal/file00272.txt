<A>Good morning.</A>
<B>Good morning.</B>
<A>My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I ask your name?</A>

<A><OL>O K</OL>. How are you today?</A>
<B>Yes, I'm fine, but I have a twins. <F>Er</F> they are two years old. And I have to take <.></.> them to <.></.> nursery school in the morning. And they are one girl and boy.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>And my boy was crying <SC>during all</SC> <F>eh</F> in the morning. <F>Er</F> he didn't want to go and <F>er</F> therefore, <SC>I have to</SC> <F>mm</F> I had to be with him bit a long time at the nursery school in the morning. <F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>I see. It must be really tough.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter>Yes indeed</laughter>.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Eh</F> but why do you think he didn't want to go to nursery school?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F> I think <F>eh</F> he <F>eh</F> has a own pace of doing something and of course nursery school has a time schedule and they have to do <F>mm</F> play time or lunch time or <R>nap</R> napping time. Then sometimes <SC>he want to</SC> <F>er</F> he didn't want to <F>uu</F> join their group work,</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F> I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>therefore</OL> he wanted to stay home, <R>p</R> playing with his miniature <.></.> car.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Eh</F> I can understand, but <F>eh</F> so, you have twins.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>Are they different?</A>
<B>Yes, they are.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. So like this morning,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>my girl <F>err</F> can do everything by herselfs</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and <SC>she is very</SC> <F>mm</F> <.></.> she is willing to join nursery school, therefore I do not take care of her so much.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> I see.</A>
<B>But not my <laughter>boy</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> must be tough. O K, by the way, <F>eh</F> did you have <F>em</F> a nice <F>eh</F> New Year holiday?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F> I think it's <F>eh</F> really short <F>er</F> because it's only five days,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>from thirtieth to third <OL>of January</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. <F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F> and <F>eh</F> we didn't have any special event because <.></.> <SC>my parents</SC> our parents are living in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, therefore we don't need to go <F>eh</F> to home or countryside in Japan. Therefore, I think <R>we</R> we stayed at home basically.</B>
<A>I see. So that's how you spent your New Year's day <OL>every year</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>. Yes.</B>
</stage1>

Maybe the other side of the mountain, there is <SC>a course</SC> another course for <F>mm</F> <SC>high</SC> <.></.> professionals.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
