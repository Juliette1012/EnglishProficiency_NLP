<A><OL>All right</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> O K.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>All right. O K. First of all, please look at this picture. And please describe this picture.</A>
<B>O K. <SC>This</SC> <F>ur</F> it's a class of math. And a female teacher is <F>ur</F> explaining about the functions with her textbook in her hand. And some students are listening to the class eagerly while others are listening <F>ur</F> to the radio, or <F>ur</F> chewing the gum, or also chatting. <F>err</F> <F>umm</F> <.></.> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. <F>Ur</F>. Can you compare this class room with the class room you had when you were in high school?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. <F>Urr</F> I used to go to <F>ur</F> girls' high school. So there were no boys, only girls. <F>Ur</F>. However the atmosphere of class room is somewhat similar. <F>Urm</F>. Some students were eager. <F>Ur</F>. On the other hand, some were <F>ur</F> playing <F>er</F> pokily like me. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Yes. Yes.</B>
<A>Did you have strict rules when you were in <OL>girls' high</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>. <F>Um</F>. We were <F>ur</F> not supposed to wear <F>ur</F> like <F>ur</F> the colored socks. Or those who had a long hair have to <F>urm</F> have <OL><??></??></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>. What do you think of forcing those rules to high school students?</A>
<B><F>Uhh</F>. But <F>um</F> as long as <SC>their</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <F>ur</F> <SC>they have</SC> teachers or school have the reason to force them, and as long as the students are convinced that it's necessary to follow those rules, I think those rules are <F>um</F> <F>mm</F> quite <F>ur</F> meaningful. But those wearing no colored socks or <laughter><??></??></laughter>, we <?>couldn't</?> understand why. So I think <F>urm</F> <??></??> just <F>um</F> force <F>um</F> to wear them without reason. I don't think those are convincing <??></??>, not meaningful.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F> What do you think of the school uniform?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> School uniform. <SC>I</SC> <F>mm</F> <F>well</F> when I was in high school, <F>um</F> <SC>I don't</SC> I didn't like them. But <F>um</F> now I feel it's quite O K. Because <F>um</F> <SC>it</SC> <F>eu</F> it's economical. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><laughter><F>Oh</F> I see</laughter></OL>.</A>
<B><SC>You're</SC> <F>urm</F> <?>just by</?> yourself, <F>urm</F> <SC>I also</SC> <F>um</F> <SC>the uniform</SC> <F>uh</F> I think that <F>ur</F> things you wear also makes one's mind. When I used to work, <F>ur</F> I wear cosmetics, and also wear suits. And even if I'm very tired, <??></??> once I <F>um</F> wear suits <SC>I have to</SC> like my mind get very <F>um</F> kind of <?>straight up</?> <??></??>. So <SC>the</SC> <SC>those</SC> every one have the same in fact.</B>

<A>I'm sorry, mom. It's against our policy.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC>if</SC> <F>urr</F> but yeah, as long as <SC>the</SC> <F>urm</F> <?>the color</?>, <F>um</F> price is same, I think it's <F>urr</F> allowed. <??></??> <SC>How does that sound</SC>, I mean how is it?</B>

See I feel very <F>ur</F> good to study.". <SC>The</SC> it's the very <SC>good</SC> big difference for me. Just it's <laughter>right there</laughter>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F> mom, I'm sorry. It's very unusual case. And <laughter>I don't know</laughter> what to do because I'm just a part time worker.</A>

We had <F>ur</F> <?>ordered</?> the things such as <F>ur</F> tents and backpack and the <F>ur</F> food and the all sorts of things for camps. And when we got to the mountains, we built our tent <F>ur</F> by the river. And we were preparing our supper. Then it started raining. And we thought it was <F>ur</F> not serious <F>ur</F> so <F>ur</F> <R>we didn't</R> <F>ur</F> we didn't take it seriously. However, it became very windy, and <SC>the storm</SC> <F>ur</F> was like a storm. So <F>urr</F> we decided to <F>ur</F> leave the place <SC>and</SC> <F>ur</F> by car. And we looked for a <F>ur</F> place to stay a night instead of the tent <SC>for</SC>. <F>Ur</F> And luckily, we came up on a hotel called Hotel Cosmos.
