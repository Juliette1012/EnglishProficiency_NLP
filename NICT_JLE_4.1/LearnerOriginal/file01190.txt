<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL>. But what was <F>ahm</F> exciting about <F>ah</F> being in a musical?</A>
<B><F>Ahm</F> I was playing the violin.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>I couldn't take the audition cause I was away for that date.</B>
<A><F>Ah-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ahm</F> since I've been playing <SC>for <F>ah</F></SC> the violin for thirteen years,</B>
<A><F>Ah-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I was the concert mistress.</B>
<A><F>Ah-huh</F>.</A>

<B><OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>.</B>
<A>Good experience.</A>
<B>Thank you.</B>
<A>O K. Thanks.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>Now, I'm gonna show you a picture. How about this one?</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. Can you tell me what you see in the picture?</A>
<B><F>Hum</F>. It's kind of school but not actually.</B>
<A><OL><laughter><F>Hum</F></laughter></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Cause</OL> the teacher <?>looks</?> very serious.</B>
<A><F>N</F>.</A>
<B><SC>She's</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> she is teaching <F>ahm</F> calculus. <F>Um</F> but the students are not serious except one <laughter>boy</laughter> seen in front of her. <F>Ahm</F> a guy, looks an Asian, is just chewing a gum. And two girls are just speaking probably loudly.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><laughter>And</laughter></OL> <SC>a boy</SC> I don't know if they're grown-ups or not, but a boy is just listening to the music by headphone and drinking something. And a girl <R>s</R> student is just playing with her cell phone. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So I don't think this is a good class, but it's a math class.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>That's it</OL>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F> O K, thanks</OL>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Ahm</F>. So could you compare this kind of class with the class that you were in in the States?</A>
<B>Compare this class to that</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>class</OL> I was in?</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ahm</F>. I'm not sure, but the numbers, but probably this is just a small class, so it's similar.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>ahm</F> students are much nicer, I think. Cause these people are not listening</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><laughter>and</laughter> I think the problem is teacher doesn't care for that <nvs>laughter</nvs> <CO>I don't know why but</CO>. <F>Ahm</F> in American school,</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>most of the students are <SC>neither</SC> <JP><F>a</F></JP> no either listening or just <laughter>sleeping</laughter>. <F>Nn</F> I think my school was a good school. I mean not so many people are sleeping</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>or playing something else.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Cause <.></.> I heard <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> State and California States are strict for the education system.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ah</F> some of my friends didn't study and they dropped the class, <laughter>but</laughter> <R>it's</R> it's not really easy to pass the class</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>unless you study <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL>. I see.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Well</F></OL>.</B>
<A>O K. So when students don't <F>ahm</F> pay attention or they are doing something that they shouldn't be doing,</A>
<B><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</B>
<A>how are they punished at that school?</A>
<B><F>Ahm</F> some of them got called from main office</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>and then just got <?>attention</?>. And if they get three of them, then the main office called their parents. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><SC>But</SC> or if they skip the classes, <F>ahm</F> they somehow find it, I mean the main office.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And then, <R>they</R> they got a attention again. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Oops. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
