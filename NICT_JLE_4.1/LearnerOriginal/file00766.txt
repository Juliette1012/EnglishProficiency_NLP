Actually <SC>I wasn't</SC> <R>I wa</R> I was not interested in law <nvs>laughter</nvs> <R>when I started</R> when I started <F>er</F> studying about law, but <F>erm</F> after several years of study, <SC>I got</SC> I'm getting interested in like <??></??>. You know, first of all, I think <F>er</F> law is about something <F>erm</F> that is necessary for <R?>inces</R?> <?>inces</?> person's feeling. Yeah. Basically, <F>er</F> <SC>the</SC> <F>erm</F> it is said that <SC>people</SC> <F>erm</F> the law is something logical and the theoretical.

<A><F>Oh</F>. O K. What do you hope to become?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. I've been hoping to be a lawyer, but <R>I</R> I just given up because I tried <R>fi</R> five years, and I taken fail exams three time, but <F>er</F> then I failed and <SC>my</SC> changed my mind to be <F>er</F> lawyer. And then I'm trying to be a scholar or expert.</B>

<A>Billiard?</A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>. <R>It's called</R> <F>er</F> it's called, "pool" in the United <laughter>States</laughter>. <laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>
