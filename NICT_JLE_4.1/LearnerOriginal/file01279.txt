<stage1>
<A>O K. Good afternoon. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. Can I have your name, please?</A>
<B>My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Call me <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> is O K?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>How are you today, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>I'm fine. Bit nervous.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> don't be <OL>nervous</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>Have you had lunch?</A>
<B>No. Not yet. I'm starving.</B>
<A>You're <laughter>starving</laughter>.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>O K. What do you usually do for lunch?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> actually, I usually don't eat breakfast. Because I always wake up very late <SC>in the</SC> in mornings, so <F>er</F> I have brunch. <F>Er</F> usually <R>I</R> I have brunch around, let's see, one or two o'clock in the <laughter>afternoon</laughter>. A really big meal. Because I don't have <F>er</F> work during the daytime usually. <R>I</R> <F>er</F> I always cook almost the same thing. Toast, egg and salad and some yogurt. Well-balanced food, I think.</B>
<A>Yeah. Sounds like well-balanced. You said <F>ei</F> you don't work <F>er</F> work in the daytime, so presumably you work in the evening?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>How do you feel about working in the evening?</A>
<B>Very unhealthy, <R>I</R> I would say. <F>Er</F> because <F>er</F> usually I leave home around five or six P. M. when people usually come back home. So <F>er</F> I realize that <F>er</F> whenever I go to work in the evening, <SC?>they</SC?> <R>the</R> the speed of people walking is rather slow <OL>compared to</OL> in the morning.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>That was very interesting. And <R>then</R> then in the evening <F>er</F> <SC?>whe</SC?> after my job is done, <F>er</F> most people got drunk. <laughter>So</laughter> I don't feel very happy about that. Otherwise, <F>um</F> pay is good. So I can't complain.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. <SC>I</SC> <F>er</F> does you work allow you to have weekends off?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>uh</F> I have Saturday work which starts from eleven-thirty until nine P M, almost non-stop. That's one of my major day. So <F>er</F> I work all day on Saturday. But usually I keep my Sundays open.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> can I ask, what did you do last Sunday?</A>
<B><laughter><F>Well</F> actually,</laughter> <F>er</F> I was doing work. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K. <F>Well</F> <F>well</F> <SC>if</SC> on a good Sunday with no work, <OL><F>oh</F></OL></A>
<B><OL>Right</OL>.</B>
<A>what do you like to do?</A>
<B>When it's really sunny day, I would like to do a lots of laundries. <F>Um</F> and I clean up the room. Basically, <F>er</F> since as I said, I usually work in the evening and the Saturdays are busiest day <R>of</R> <F>mm</F> of the week, so I usually dead sleep on Sunday.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. Nothing special.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Sometimes</OL> I go out with my friend to drink or eat something.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>You have your own house?</A>
<B>Yep. It's not a house, it's condominium. But yes.</B>
<A>It's yours?</A>
<B>Yep.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> <??></??>. Now <F>well</F> <SC>ho</SC> what's the advantage of having your own house?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> Obviously I don't have <R>to</R> <F>ur</F> to pay for rent. That's a good advantage. But I still like got a lots of loan.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>sigh</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>But <R>still</R></OL> <nvs>laughter</nvs> still I feel like I can do <SC>whatever</SC> <OL>what I want <F>er</F></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F> <F>mh-hmm</F> <F>hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><F>er</F> you know, to create my room. And then <R>I can</R> I can use <R>the</R> <R>the</R> <F>uh</F> <R>the</R> the pin on <R>the</R> the wall <OL>to hang up</OL> something</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>without worrying about the <F>er</F> landlord. And also I can keep my pets. It's a good point.</B>
<A>O K. Good.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>I'd like to <F>er</F> show you a picture now, if I may.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>It's a</OL> picture of a restaurant.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>I'd like you to describe this for me, <OL>please</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>. <F>Er</F> this is <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the picture of a restaurant. <F>Er</F> there are three tables. And <F>er</F> each table's got <F>er</F> customers, basically couples. And <F>er</F> there is a <SC>big ta mi</SC> big table in the middle. And a couple is sitting. A guy with a yellow jacket is tasting the wine with a big smile. And <SC>the</SC> <F>um</F> his <SC?>le</SC?> <F>er</F> right side, <SC>his</SC> maybe <F>er</F> his girlfriend or wife is sitting, smiling at him, too. <F>Er</F> yeah. The other side of <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the table, a waiter is standing, holding the <F>er</F> very nice, thick bottle of wine, showing the <F>er</F> <SC>lagel</SC> label to this guy. I think <F>er</F> he's going to accept to have this wine. And behind that, there is <R>a</R> <F>er</F> <SC>a bunch of wines</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>the bottle of wines</SC> <F>er</F> <F>ur</F> <F>uh</F> bottles of wine, sorry. And <F>er</F> it's looks like <F>er</F> this is a very luxurious hotel because <SC>there are</SC> there's a big space between tables. And <F>er</F> it's <F>er</F> seven o'clock. There's a big clock <F>er</F> right next to the wall. So I believe this is the <F>er</F> dinnertime. <F>Er</F> next to <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the clock, there's a piano. Upright, I think. Yeah. And a lady is playing the music.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><?>Thank you</?></OL> very much.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Yes. It seems a very fancy restaurant. Now</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>if you go around in Tokyo, there are many fancy restaurants and I guess they must have customers. Why do you think that <F>er</F> eating out is such a big deal in Tokyo?</A>
<B><F>Oooh</F> I think of the big reason is that <F>er</F> the people who is working at <R>the</R> the <F>er</F> center of Tokyo are working so hard during weekdays. And <F>er</F> <F>er</F> they don't have enough time <SC>to cook</SC> to prepare <R>their</R> their meals by themselves. And then there are lots of <F>er</F> people who are living by themselves just like me. And <F>er</F> <R>i</R> it's too much work to cook and do dishes. So <F>er</F> eating out is much easier. Or of course, <R>it</R> it costs a lot. But <F>er</F> still, you can enjoy the meal talking with friends <R>and</R> and the co-workers. That's why I think it's popular.</B>
<A><nvs>smack</nvs> What's the best way to find a restaurant that's sort of suits your taste?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>I don't mean literally taste <OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I know, I know</OL>.</B>
<A><??></??>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> gee. I don't know. <F>Um</F> <..></..> <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> <R>I u</R> <nvs>sigh</nvs> I usually don't eat out. As I said, I usually <R>c</R> cook at home simply because <R>it's</R> it's more economical. <F>Um</F> but <F>er</F> when I eat out, I usually go out to <JP>izakaya</JP>, Japanese-style bar with my friends. Yeah. <?>But</?> I like <JP>izakaya</JP>, a Japanese-style bar much better than <F>er</F> Western-style bar. Because Western-style bar, <SC>they don't serve</SC> <F>eh</F> they usually don't serve meals. <nvs>smack</nvs> <F>Er</F> we just keep standing and <F>uh</F> holding the <F>er</F> beer bottle until it gets <F>er</F> <SC>warm temperature</SC> <F>uh</F> room temperature. <laughter>And I don't</laughter> like that. So <F>er</F> I like to eat and drink at the same time. Yeah.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much.</A>

<stage3>
<task>
<A>I'd like to try a role-play with you, if I may.</A>
<B>Sure.</B>

<B>O K.</B>
<A><SC>Plea thi</SC> read this to yourself, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. And then <F>um</F> read it to yourself. When you're ready,</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>I'll begin.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>You understand that?</A>
<B>I think so. <OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. Anything's O K.</A>
<B>All right. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. Good afternoon, ma'am. Can I help you at all?</A>
<B>Yes, please. <F>Um</F> suppose this is a pet shop. Is that O K? O K. <F>Um</F> yes. <R>I</R> I got this puppy about five days ago. <F>Er</F> <.></.> and when I <SC>bought i</SC> bought him, one of your sales clerk <SC>says that</SC> said that <F>er</F> this is really friendly puppy. But actually he is notorious. He just keep barking and biting me and my cats. I have two cats.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>um</F> you know, they don't just <R>ge</R> get along with each other very <F>well</F>. So <R>if</R> if it's possible, I would like to return this puppy <OL>to you</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Well</F></OL> you know, I'm sure <R>the</R> the person who recommended it didn't know that you had cats <OL>in the house</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <F>Oh</F> I told him. I told him.</B>
<A>You did?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> these things take time.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>Now it's only five days.</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A><?>It is breaking</?> in time.</A>
<B>But you know, <R>he</R> he is biting my kitty. <nvs>laughter</nvs> You know? And <F>uh</F> <R>a</R> apparently, he is not very happy staying in my house. I can tell. <F>Er</F> I used to keep dogs for <SC>te</SC> more than ten years and I do know the <F>er</F> dog's personality. And apparently this dog doesn't belong to my house. And <F>er</F> <SC>if think about <SC>his life</SC> I mean this puppy's life for the rest of his life</SC> you know, <SC>if I</SC> once <R>I</R> I got <F>er</F> the pet, <SC>I would like to take care of it</SC> <R>I</R> I would like to take care of him <F>um</F> <F>er</F> for the rest of his life. But apparently he doesn't look very happy. And thinking about his happiness, you know, <SC>I would</SC> I don't want to keep him.</B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>For</R></OL> <R>for my</R> for my happiness and my cats' happiness and then, you know, from the <F>er</F> humane point of view, I don't think it's a really good idea for me to keep this pet.</B>
<A>I understand. Thank you for your sympathy towards the dog. Unfortunately, you know, all the paper work that we had to go through five days <OL>ago</OL>,</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><F>well</F> <F>er</F> that's confirmed. It will take a long time for that paper work to be</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>complete. Until that is, we can't really accept the dog back.</A>
<B>How long does it take?</B>
<A>At least another week.</A>
<B>Week. <nvs>smack</nvs> O K.</B>
<A>We can sell you a restraining bite.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> It's really <laughter>bad</laughter>. It's really cruel for this little puppy. I don't like that.</B>
<A>Or I could try to rush things, maybe?</A>
<B>Please do. <F>Er</F> <F>well</F> in that case, I can keep him in the <F>er</F> other room which I have, you know, extra room. So <F>uh</F> I can confine him in that room for next five days if it's O K with you.</B>
<A>That sounds good. <F>Um</F> if you could do that, I'll really rush things through.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>We've <OL>got to</OL> solve this.</A>
<B><OL>Then</OL> I will wait for five days.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><OL>Is that O K</OL>?</B>
<A><OL>I'll get back to you</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Thank you</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Thank you</OL> very much.</A>
<B>I'll talk to you later, then.</B>
<A><laughter>O K</laughter>. O K. That's the end of the role-play.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Thank you very much.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>You talked about the personality <SC>of your</SC> of <R>the</R> <SC>the</SC> this imaginary dog.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Er</F> tell me about the personality of your cats.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> O K. Yeah. I do have a <F>er</F> <R>two c</R> two cats, as a matter of fact. Both of them are really old. You said the personality?</B>
<A>Yeah. The character.</A>
<B>Characters. <F>Er</F> <F>ugh</F> before these two kitties, I never had a cat before. <SC>And</SC> <F>er</F> but that time was the first time when I had these kitties. I didn't think that cat had personalities. But now I have two of them. But <SC>they</SC> those two got totally different personalities. I realized that. <R>Then</R> then if you keep the cats long enough, you can really tell what they want <F>er</F> from the way they meow <SC>or</SC> at me or <SC>they</SC> the way they look at me or they rub their heads, <F>er</F> you know. <F>Er</F> those kind of thing you can really tell</B>
<A><?>I'm sure</?>.</A>
<B>what they want.</B>
<A><OL><F>Wow</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So it's</OL> really interesting.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>.</A>

<B>Sure.</B>
<A>Now this happened before.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>So I want you to start the story, "One day last week," and then begin.</A>
<B>O K. Let's see. <nvs>cough</nvs> One day last week, <R>my friend</R> my friend, Naomi and I <F>er</F> went camping. So <F>er</F> in order to do that, we had prepared lots of camping gears <F>er</F> including tents and foods and everything. And we packed everything, we loaded everything in the back of the seat of my car, which was yellow. And <F>um</F> <.></.> it was Oregon State in the United States. So <F>er</F> we went to the <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> near Mount Saint Helen. Then we pitched tent. Everything went all right. <F>Eh</F> Naomi <JP>san</JP> <SC?>e</SC?> knew exactly what she had to do to pitch a tent. I start cooking. <F>Er</F> I think that was <F>er</F> curry rice. <F>Er</F> it looked really fun. Then all of the sudden, <SC>it start to ra</SC> it started to rain. And <F>er</F> I was really worry because <SC>you can't p</SC> you couldn't predict <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the weather of the mountain. But Naomi said, "No, it's all right. Let's keep doing that.". <F>Er</F> however, maybe thirty minutes later, <SC>it</SC> <F>er</F> the wind began <F>ur</F> to be really strong. And <F>er</F> tent blown away. Everything's just blown away because the <F>er</F> wind was so strong. So we just rush into the car. <F>Er</F> try to wait a little bit. But <F>er</F> <SC>the way</SC> <F>uh</F> the wind and storm didn't stop. So we decided to move along. We <SC>start drivi</SC> we started to drive. And we happened to find a nice, cozy <R>hot</R> <F>er</F> hotel called "Hotel Cosmos". So we decided to check in. <F>Er</F> fortunately, the room was available. So <F>er</F> we stayed there. And we took a shower and have a nice cup of coffee.</B>
<A>O K. A nice happy ending.</A>
