<B><F>Ur</F> mostly it's the food.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>I used to like MacDonald's, but they don't have that much. I mean they do have it, but it's too expensive to buy it.</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> what do you mean by expensive to buy?</A>
<B>Yeah, like the food,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>

<B><F>Urr</F> there's a house and there's a car with the cat sleeping on it.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And in front of the car, two women are talking and one of the women <nvs>cough</nvs> with <F>ur</F> red clothing having a dog. And speaking of the dog, two dogs <?>are</?> like looking at each other in front of the house.

<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>Just the same.</B>
<A><nvs>smack</nvs> O K. And what is the most memorable experience you had in <?>where you lived</?>?</A>
