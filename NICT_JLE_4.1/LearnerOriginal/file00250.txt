<A>O K. Let's begin. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. What is your name?</A>
<B>My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Yes. <OL>Of course</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H></OL>. How are you today?</A>
<B>I'm very fine. <OL>Thank you</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL>. O K. <F>Well</F> it's Friday today. But what do you usually do on Friday?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I work on <F>erm</F> <F>ah</F> temporary basis. I work as a <F>er</F> coordinator for overseas participants. And <F>er</F> my job just finished last week. So, I have free time today.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> I see. <F>Hmm</F>. So, <.></.> where do you live?</A>
<B>I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <F>Uh-huh</F>. Where in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <F>erm</F> it's on the <F>ur</F> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> line. It's about ten minutes away from the station. <R>I live</R> I live in an <R>a</R> apartment.</B>
<A>I see. Do you live with your family?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> no. I live alone.</B>
<A>I see. What do you like best about living alone?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>erm</F> first of all, <F>erm</F> the best thing <F>er</F> to live alone is that nobody <F>er</F> criticize me even if <R>I</R> I don't clean up <nvs>laughter</nvs> completely. And also, on weekends, <R>I can</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> I can be in the bed as long as I want. I think that's the best thing <.></.> living alone.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> that's nice. O K. Then, when you have a lot of free time, what do you like to do?</A>
<B>I like traveling very much. And I usually <F>er</F> prefer <F>er</F> traveling alone <SC>and with</SC> <F>er</F> as a backpacker. It's a <??></??> cheap traveling, but <F>er</F> in that way, I can have <F>er</F> more chances to talk with local people.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F> I see. <F>Erm</F> but, sometimes <?>that</?> you have difficulties?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> yes. <F>Er</F> very much.</B>
<A>For example?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> for instance, <F>erm</F> when I went to <F>er</F> Spain a few years ago, <F>erm</F> I didn't know that the local people <F>er</F> don't speak English a lot. And I don't speak Spanish a lot. Only <R>I</R> I learned a few sentences before I left here. So, <F>erm</F> <F>err</F> very often, I had <F>er</F> difficulty <F>er</F> with communicating the local people, especially when I have to <F>erm</F> take transportation. <F>Urm</F>. <.></.> <F>Er</F> international airport is O K, but if I go to the local <F>er</F> bus terminal station <F>erm</F> not many people understand English. So, it took me more time to get a ticket and to go to <F>er</F> right <F>er</F> platform. So, every time <SC>I <.></.> have to move</SC> I had to move, it took more time.</B>
<A>I see. O K. Then did you have any problems with <SC>food</SC> the local food?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> not at all. <F>Erm</F> I think Spanish food is very <F>er</F> <.></.> suitable to Japanese people. I found it very similar to <F>er</F> Japanese food, because they eat a lot of <F>er</F> seafood. And <.></.> Spanish food is also very popular here, so I was very familiar with that.</B>

And <.></.> <F>erm</F> <R>a car is</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> a car is parking in front of the <F>er</F> big house. And there are two women <F>er</F> chatting each other. One of them <F>er</F> <.></.> <R>w</R> walks a dog. And a man wearing <SC>s</SC> <F>er</F> wet suit is jogging in front of the house. And there are two dogs facing each other on the lawn just in front of the house, and they seem to be owned by the owner of this house. <F>Er</F> a small girl is playing <F>eh</F> in front of the big window <.></.> <F>er</F> who seems to <.></.> be a daughter of this <F>er</F> family. And there are two other boys playing with a ball, <F>er</F> seemingly playing <F>er</F> <F>uh</F> volleyball. <F>Er</F> they seems to be elementary school students. Across the street, <F>er</F> there is a <.></.> <F>er</F> big white house. In front of the house, a middle-aged man <F>er</F> wearing glasses is reading a paper on the bench.</B>

<B>O K.</B>
<A>Hello. May I help you, miss?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Erm</F> I missed my train. And <F>er</F> I had a reservation <R>se</R> seat <F>er</F> in the train. So, <F>er</F> I'd like you to refund <F>er</F> my ticket.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. It's against our policy but <F>hmm</F> if you have any good reason, <.></.> maybe.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> yesterday, <SC>it was <F>er</F> heavy snow</SC> there was heavy snow in Tokyo. So, <F>er</F> the subway I had to take <F>er</F> was greatly delayed and <F>er</F> although <R>I</R> <F>eh</F> <.></.> I went to the station at the right time, but <SC>the train</SC> the subway train <R>didn't</R> <F>er</F> didn't start <F>er</F> for half an hour. So, <F>erm</F> <.></.> that made me <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> delay. <F>Ur</F> <.></.> that's why <R>I</R> I couldn't <F>er</F> <F>er</F> get to station <F>er</F> at the right time.

<A><F>Hmm</F> I see. And how did you feel at that time?</A>

And <F>ur</F> soon after that, <F>erm</F> the thunderstorm <F>er</F> started. <R>We</R> <F>er</F> we had no choice but to find <F>er</F> hotel. <F>Er</F> a few minutes after we drove, we find a nice hotel <F>er</F> named <F>er</F> Hotel Cosmos. <F>Er</F> <.></.> by that time, the weather <R>beca</R> became even worse. But luckily, <R>we could</R> <F>ur</F> we could get a nice room <F>er</F> with a beautiful scenery.
