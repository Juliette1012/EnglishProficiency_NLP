<B>O K. <F>Mm</F>. One day last week, <F>ur</F> I and my friend <SC>was</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>we</R> <SC>went to camping</SC> <F>ur</F> went camping by my car.

<A><F>Mm</F>. O K.</A>
<B>That's <?>it</?>.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. Thank you very much.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So you mentioned that you like driving with your husband. <F>Urm</F> how do you usually decide which place to go?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> it's <F>mm</F> up to <F>mm</F> which place we are <laughter>interested in</laughter>. But like we sometimes go <R>to</R> <F>ur</F> to see <F>ur</F> temples and shrines since my husband likes old historical buildings. Then we sometimes go to Kamakura or <SC>we</SC> <F>well</F> we went to Kyoto last year.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>But basically he always asked me where I want to go. So I guess I <laughter>usually decide</laughter></B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>where to go.</B>
<A>Good husband.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>Yes</laughter>.</B>
<A>Yeah. Could you tell me about the last one?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> last trip we went to. <F>Well</F> let's see, we went to Kyoto last <SC>Dec</SC> <F>ur</F> no, November.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ur</F> one of my cousin got married in Kobe. We went to wedding party in Kobe <R>on</R> on Friday. Then we had a nice wedding party in Kobe. After that, we went to Kyoto and stayed there <SC>for two</SC> no, for three days.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <R>we</R> we looked around Kyoto City. It was nice trip, but it was really nice day so there were so many people <laughter>there</laughter>. <F>Ur</F> we sometimes couldn't see <F>ur</F> really important <F>ur</F> treasures because there were so many people.</B>
<A>I see. So <R>what</R> what do you think <F>ur</F> of the advantages of driving a car to go somewhere <F>ur</F> other than traveling <R>in</R> in a train?</A>
<B>Train. <F>Well</F> I guess <F>ur</F> for me, I don't really drive <laughter>so</laughter> it's really <F>ur</F> comfortable and <F>ur</F> <R>feel</R> <F>ur</F> feel much <F>er</F> better than the train because I don't have to stand up all the way to that area. And in a train, we don't really talk a lot.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> my husband sometimes sleeps <OL><laughter>or</laughter></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>read books all the time. But in a car, <F>ur</F> since my husband is driving, we can talk a lot so that's one of the advantage, I guess.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F>. O K.</A>
