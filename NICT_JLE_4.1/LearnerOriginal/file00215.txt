<A>O K, so, how are you today?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> I'm very <F>ah</F> anxious about this test.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah, so <F>ah</F> <R>after</R> after lunchtime</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>I was studying <OL><F>er</F> the English</OL></B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B>and <F>ah</F> I was <F>uh</F> <R>re</R> reviewing <F>ah</F> the S S T lesson.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>Yes. <SC>I'm preparing</SC> <F>ah</F> I was preparing about this test. And so <laughter>I was very scared</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Umm</F>.</B>
<A>So, you feel better now?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> yes. I was relax now.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> good. O K, so <F>ah</F> it's freezing these days.</A>
<B><F>Ah-hm</F>.</B>
<A>So, what do you usually do when it snows?</A>
<B>It's, rain, snow?</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I bought <R>sho</R> short ski <F>uh</F> two weeks ago and yes <R>I</R> I usually go to snow mountain,</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>for example, to Nigata prefecture. <F>Uh</F> I have a <SC>dro</SC> a car, so I will go to Nigata with my friends. <F>Uh</F> <F>eh</F> <R>it</R> it takes two hours or three hours to get to the ski place.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> yes, and <SC>maybe</SC> usually, <F>ah</F> I will go to Nigata <F>eh</F> at night of Friday and I can reach there <F>ah</F> <R>in mo</R> in morning of Saturday. So, I can ski all day on Saturday.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>And, after that I will come back to Tokyo.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>, I see. So, you mentioned about short ski.</A>
<B>Short ski.</B>
<A>Can you tell more about it?</A>
<B><F>Ah-hm</F> <F>uh</F> <SC>short ski is usually</SC> <F>ah</F> the ski board is very long, maybe taller than my height or your height.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>But, short ski is shorter than normal ski.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>, I have a one meter ski. It's <SC>very shor</SC> <F>ah</F> shorter than normal ski. <F>Ah</F> if you use short ski <F>ah</F> you can easy turn to right, turn to the left. Because the, <R>long</R> long <F>um</F> if <SC>they</SC> <F>ah</F> <R?>they're long</R?> <SC><?>they're</?> long normal ski</SC> <F>ah</F> the top of ski and end of ski sometimes crossing.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>Short ski, not so difficult. And the length is not so long. So <R>we can't</R> we can't ski faster than normal ski. If there is a long board <R>you can</R> you can get more speed. It's different from normal ski.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>If, there is no <JP>stock</JP> <F>um</F> <SC>in</SC> <R>when</R> when we ski short ski.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>So, if you can ski, <F>mm</F> you can easily ski <F>ah</F> short ski.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
