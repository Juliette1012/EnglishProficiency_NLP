<A>All right. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>May I have</OL> your name, please?</A>
<B>Sure. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Nice to meet you.</A>
<B>Nice to meet you.</B>
<A>How are you today?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. I'm fine. <nvs>laughter</nvs> I mean, <F>er</F> recently, I couldn't take enough sleep. So I'm a little bit sleepy all day long. But it's O K.</B>
<A>Really? Why can't you sleep?</A>
<B>Because <F>er</F> lot of work. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>I know. Everybody said so. Would you tell me about your job?</A>
<B>I'm working on <F>erm</F> marketing section.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And I'm in charge of <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But now, the <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> <SC>con</SC> <SC?>fon</SC?> shampoo and conditioner has been launched. And we are suffering from <SC>that</SC> <F>er</F> the launch. Because they increase a share,</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>hmm</F> from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. So we are suffering. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. I see.</A>
<B>So there are many things to do and also we have many activities,</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>to hold number one position in the market.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>. I see.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>. <CO>But I know that everybody complains about</CO>.</B>
<A>Everybody <OL>complained <?>to me</?></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>Yeah. But when you have free time, what do you like to do?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. For example, weekends, <R>I</R> I just want to sleep until twelve at noon. And just relax, a coffee. Just read some magazines or just have lunch with my friends.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So that's the way I relax myself.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>.</B>
<A>So everybody says that <F>well</F> you have no time to work out, <.></.> right?</A>
<B><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>So <F>well</F> is there anything that <.></.> <F>well</F> you can do,</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>.</B>
<A><SC>for your health</SC> <.></.> to stay in health <OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Actually</OL>, I'm thinking of starting to work out.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> But of course, I cannot go to gym <SC>on</SC> <F>oh</F> during weekdays. So I have to go there on <SC>weekday</SC> weekends. But <F>mmm</F> other things to relax myself, like for example, I just put <SC>the bath</SC> <R>a</R> additives to the bath, while I'm bathing.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Or <F>mmm</F> just walk <nvs>laughter</nvs> in the neighborhood.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>. <CO>Or</CO>. <F>Mmm</F>. But I have to start to work out, anyway.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F>. Would you tell me a bit about your neighborhood?</A>
<B>My neighborhood? I live in <F>er</F> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> Line.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><R>I</R> I just moved <SC>to</SC> <F>er</F> from <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. And it's very comfortable <SC>to be hi</SC> <F>erm</F> staying there. Because there are many shops. I mean, not like a fashionable shops. Not boutiques but more like a convenient <F>er</F> shops like <F>er</F> lunch box shops <OL><laughter>or</laughter></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>more reasonable shops.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>And also it's very close to Shibuya.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I don't need to take time from <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> to go everywhere. But when I live in <SC><H pn="others6">XXX08</H></SC> <F>er</F> <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>, it takes more than one hour,</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>to go</OL> everywhere. So it's much comfortable. <OL>So <F>mh-hmm</F></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> O K</OL>. <OL><R>Why</R></OL></A>
<B><OL>convenient</OL>.</B>
<A>why did you moved to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. Because <F>mmm</F> actually, I came back from the U. S. last October. And that time, <SC>I didn't ti</SC> I didn't have a house. Because <SC>my parents</SC> I used to live with my parents in <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>. But they moved to <H pn="others7">XXX09</H>.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And that house belongs to my aunt.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And she is thinking of selling it to someone or she is <.></.> <F>er</F> renting it.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>Someone. So I didn't have a house for myself. So that's why <SC>I move</SC> <R>I</R> <F>er</F> I started to look for a house. And of course I wanted to move <SC>to</SC> in the city.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>. I <OL>see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>So you are enjoying your city life.</A>
<B><F>Er</F>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Not really. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><laughter>Really</laughter>? <F>Oh</F> what do you mean?</A>
<B>Maybe I mean, yes on weekends. But not during weekdays.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. I see. O K.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>Now,</A>
<B><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>I'm going to show you a picture. This one. Would you describe it to me?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. This is a picture of a classroom. And <F>er</F> the teacher is standing <SC>on some boards</SC> in front of <R>the</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> the blackboard. And <SC>she is explaining</SC> maybe she is a teacher of mathematics. <SC?>And</SC?> <F>er</F> but only a few student, actually, one student <F>er</F> <..></..> <F>er</F> concentrated on that class. But <SC>other people</SC> other students are <.></.> ignoring her class. For example, one guy with a regent, <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>the <R>funny</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> funny hairstyle, he is just <SC>tei</SC> having <SC>a ba</SC> <F>erm</F> the gum. And maybe sleeping, not sleeping. <SC>But</SC> and also other girls, they are just chatting each other. <R>And</R> <.></.> and <F>er</F> other people are <SC>just to</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> just ignore the class like checking the e-mails on the cell phone or just <R>dri</R> <R>drinking</R> <.></.> <F>er</F> drinking some tea or something.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>O K. <OL><??></??></OL></B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><OL>Why do you</OL> think they are ignoring the teacher <.></.> teaching math?</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>. I think it's because she <SC>sa</SC> just talking to the board. She is not looking at <SC>she</SC> <F>er</F> students.</B>
<ctxt>somebody is entering the room</ctxt>
<A>Sorry.</A>
<B>And <.></.> <F>mmm</F>. Maybe <R>I can</R> <F>em</F> I can <SC>dan</SC> understand their feeling. Because <SC>I also <F>er</F> don't</SC> I didn't like mathematics. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><laughter>So</laughter> <SC>I can feel the their fe</SC> I can understand their feelings. Maybe her lesson is just boring. Or <?>maybe</?> they just don't want to <R>s</R> study mathematics, except for the guy in front of her.</B>
<A>Right. <..></..> So do you remember your high school days or junior high school days?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Hm-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>In those days, were you a good student? <CO>Not so</CO>.</A>
<B>I was, <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>a good student, I think.</B>
<A>So can you compare the atmosphere of the classroom?</A>
<B>First, <R>they don't</R> <F>er</F> they don't wear <SC>the uniform</SC> the school uniform. To me, they look very free. They behave very freely. <SC>In my high school</SC> my high school was very strict. So it's not prohibited to bring the cell phone or like a C D Walkman or,</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>that kind of stuff. If I brought that kind of things, definitely the teacher would <F>er</F> just take it from me <.></.> that I can focus on <?>this</?> lesson. So the atmosphere is completely different. And also <F>mm</F> my <SC>s</SC> high school is so strict that <.></.> <SC>like a</SC> of course, I have to wear the uniform. The hairstyle. <SC>I have to</SC> I cannot change <F>er</F> the hairstyle so often.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Because if my hair length is longer than my shoulder, I have to, <?>I guess</?>, tie up. So I couldn't enjoy changing the hairstyle. Or of course, I couldn't change my color <OL>of the hair</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>So everything is <F>em</F> allowed in this class.</B>
<A>Right. But now, you can enjoy your hairstyle.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>Of course</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>So I think because I had a hard time in <F>er</F> high school,</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>that's why <SC>I'm</SC> I can enjoy,</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>the current life.</B>
<A>I understand.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> O K.</A>

<A>Now, we are doing role-play.</A>
<B><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>Role-play.</A>
<B>Role-play.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is choosing a card.</ctxt>
<A>All right. O K. <..></..> O K. Please read this card. <..></..> And when you are ready, I'll begin. O K?</A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B><F>Oh</F>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. Some <.></.> tough situation. O K. Right.</B>
<A>O K. Hi, may I help you, ma'am?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. <.></.> <R>I bought</R> <..></..> I bought an iron <.></.> at this shop.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But <SC>I</SC> <..></..> <F>mmm</F> <R>what</R> <F>ah</F> what is a excuse for it? I use it at night. But it wasn't warmed up enough. So I want to return it. And exchange it. Or <F>mmm</F> <F>mmm</F> <F>er</F> <SC>I want to chan</SC> <F>ah</F> I want to exchange to other one.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Really? <F>Well</F>. <R>I</R> it has never happened <.></.> to our store. And sorry, <SC>we</SC> <F>well</F> that's against our policy. And we cannot do that.</A>
<B>But <SC>I already</SC> <F>ah</F> I have a receipt that <F>erm</F> confirms that I bought this iron at this store. And it is true that it didn't work. <SC>If you</SC> <F>er</F> I know you that you have <SC>some</SC> like a <F>er</F> company policy, but I cannot accept it. I'm sorry. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>O K. Let me check. <F>Well</F>. Sorry, ma'am. It was on sale. It was extremely cheap. And it says "You cannot exchange it.".</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>. <..></..> <F>Er</F>. But in <SC>this book</SC> instruction book, it says "It warmed up enough,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>to work for <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the clothes.". But it didn't. <OL>So</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F> really</OL>?</A>
<B><R>I</R> I don't think I can trust this product. So anyway, I cannot <SC><laughter>use</laughter> this</SC> continue to use this product anyway.</B>
<A>I understand. But <F>well</F> it's not our fault. <F>Well</F> maybe the factory's fault.</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>. So you mean that <F>er</F> you can contact to the factory?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Of course, you can do it by yourself. You can give them a call.</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>. <..></..> But <R>I</R> I always use this store.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F> really</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>I really</OL> like to shop <SC>this</SC> at this store. <CO><SC>Because</SC> so, I'm sorry but <R>I</R> I have to say that if</CO>. <F>Erm</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Only this time, O K, you can exchange to another one.</A>
<B><F>Hm-hmm</F>. O K.</B>
<A>O K. You can <R>take a</R> take a look at <R>the</R> the other products here.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. That's very kind of you. Very. Thank you. <OL>Thank you very much</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>But only this</OL> time. <OL>O K</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>. It's hard negotiation.</B>
<A><laughter>O K</laughter>. This is the end of the role-play.</A>
<B><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Well</F>, when you were in the States, <F>well</F> <R>ha</R> have you ever had any <.></.> chance to negotiate with people there?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. I have to say always, because <nvs>laughter</nvs> especially in the States, <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I try to think of the example. <F>Erm</F> <nvs>tsk</nvs> <.></.> yeah, <SC>for example, I ha</SC> <.></.> <F>er</F> <nvs>tsk</nvs> for example, when I was on the train,</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and <F>mmm</F> I didn't get the ticket. Because at <SC>the s</SC> my nearest station, there is <R>no</R> no one working there. But <F>er</F> the conductor thought that I didn't get the ticket. Because I didn't have money. Or because I just wanted to cheat it.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>And I explained that I got on the train from that station which nobody's <SC>there</SC> working there. And <.></.> the person <F>er</F> <SC>understan</SC> understood my situation or something like that.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>. O K.</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>.</B>
<A>So <R>you</R> you've gotten use to it.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><SC>Of c</SC> in Japanese, yes. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>But of course in English, it's more difficult to <SC>de</SC> negotiate. Because I have to translate,</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>from Japanese to English. And I have to speak at the same time. So,</B>
<A><OL>I can imagine</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>it's much</OL> harder.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much.</A>

<A><OL><F>Well</F> you can decide</OL>.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. O K.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>. One day of the last week, my boyfriend drove a car. <..></..> And <SC>in from</SC> <R>from</R> <F>er</F> from the opposite direction, <..></..> the guy talking on the cell phone was <F>er</F> driving a <.></.> motorcycle. <.></.> That person seem to talk to her girlfriend with a cell phone <SC>even he was driving</SC> while he was driving. <.></.> But when my boyfriend tried to curve on the <SC>s</SC> road, the guy with the cell phone, <F>er</F> <SC>act</SC> attacked to the car. And at that time, the cell phone was <R>broken</R> <.></.> <F>erm</F> broken. And the guy <.></.> with the cell phone complained about that cell phone was destroyed because of my boyfriend. So decided to call the police. And my boyfriend <F>er</F> <SC>explained</SC> <JP><F>ee</F></JP> <.></.> <R>explain about the situation</R> <.></.> <JP><F>ee</F></JP> explain about the situation. I don't know what it means. <..></..> <F>Mmm</F>? Sorry. <R>I</R> I couldn't get the point of this cartoon.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F></A>
<B><CO><OL>There's no</OL></CO>.</B>
<A><OL><R>You can</R></OL> you can make up,</A>
<B><OL><JP><F>Haa</F></JP></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>the</OL> story somehow.</A>
<B><..></..> <F>Mmm</F>. And <SC>the guy with the cell phone</SC> <..></..> O K, while <SC>h</SC> the guy <R>with</R> with the cell phone parking the motorcycle on the street, <F>er</F> <..></..> <SC>the person</SC> the cleaner <.></.> <F>er</F> came by. And he didn't notice that motorcycle was belong to the guy. Instead, <SC>he wo</SC> he just <F>er</F> took it from him as a garbage. And <laughter>the cleaner</laughter> left.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>So the guy with a cell phone lost the <R>ce</R> cell phone and also the motorcycle at the same time. So it was <.></.> unlucky day for him.</B>
<A>Right. Good. O K.</A>
<B><laughter>I don't know</laughter> what <R>the pe</R> <F>er</F> the people, <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> that's fine</OL>.</A>
<B>think about.</B>

<B><F>Hm-hmm</F></B>
<A>O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Well</F>. Did you drive in the States?</A>
<B>Yes. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>That's a first time I drove a car.</B>
<A>Really?</A>
<B><R>I</R> I already had a car license. I got the car license in Japan. But I didn't drive. Because my family didn't have a car.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And also my boyfriend hate my driving. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>That's why I didn't drive in Japan. But in the States, I live in Connecticut.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So it is natural that I have to drive a car. Because there is nothing. Train comes only once an hour.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <.></.> So how was the <R>ro</R> road condition compared to Tokyo?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. Compared to Tokyo. <F>Mmm</F>. I should say it's much better than Japan. Because there are no motorcycle.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Maybe some motorcycles on <?>the</?> highway. But not so many like in Japan. Or of course, there are not so many pedestrian on the street,</B>
<A>Right, right</A>
<B>in the States. If there many <SC>s</SC> pedestrian, it might be <F>er</F> very dangerous in the States. <R>So</R> so in that sense, there is no obstacle on the street. So it's much comfortable, and I never drove in Japan. So <SC>I</SC> to me, it's easier to get used to driving on the left side.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>The opposite side from Japan. <OL>Right side, the left side</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Right, so the right side</OL> in the States.</A>
<B>Right side in the States.</B>
<A>Right.</A>

<A>left side.</A>

<A>And what's you gonna do after this?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> After this, maybe I'm gonna finish the document for the research brief or very administrative job. <CO>It's</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Right. So you'll be busy all day.</A>
