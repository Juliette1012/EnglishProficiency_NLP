<A>Are you ready?</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. Hello. May I help you?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> hello, <R>I</R> <F>uhm</F> I am a participant of <SC>the</SC> <.></.> <F>urm</F> <.></.> <F>urr</F> your travel agency.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> this is a <.></.> <F>uhm</F> <.></.> <??></??>?</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. Yes. Use your imagination.</A>
<B>O K. <.></.> O K. <.></.> I'm a participant of <?>Kenya</?> study tour.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><SC>So</SC> <F>urm</F> <.></.> <R>and</R> and today <SC>what</SC> why I <F>urm</F> call up you is <F>urr</F> <F>urr</F> it is <.></.> far from what I have expected were different, it is very different. So <SC>I'd like to</SC> <F>ur</F> <.></.> I'd like you to explain what it is <R>and</R> and if you can, <F>urm</F> I'd like your compensation. <.></.> <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>I see. Can you tell me what happened?</A>
<B>O K. <F>Urr</F> <.></.> first of all, you said that, <F>urr</F> <.></.> we will stay <SC>at</SC> <F>eh</F> in the <F>urr</F> <.></.> most <.></.> <SC>luxurious one</SC></B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B><SC>luxurious and</SC> <.></.> luxurious <F>urm</F> hotel where we can eat <F>er</F> Japanese food in the morning and in evening. But actually, there's no Japanese food <R>and</R> <.></.> and <.></.> I've got a stomachache <SC>and</SC> <F>urr</F> because of <SC>the</SC> <SC>this</SC> <.></.> <SC>the</SC> these foods are not so clean <SC>but</SC> <SC>and</SC> <.></.> for us, Japanese.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Well</F> did you complain that <SC>to the officer</SC> to the <F>urr</F> person in the hotel?</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F> <.></.> no, because <.></.> there's a tour conductor of our <.></.> tour and I asked her. But she said that <F>urm</F> <.></.> she cannot <F>er</F> talk with the officer of the hotel. And since I was very sick, so I had to go to hospital, and <SC>there's no time</SC> there was not time to <F>urr</F> talk with the officer of the hotel.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Well</F> usually in that case, the tour conductor should have talked with the hotel manager.</A>
<B>Yeah. <R>Her</R> <F>er</F> her treatment of me was very rude for me, and was unbelievable. And she didn't <F>er</F> fulfill her responsibility. <SC>So, <.></.> <F>urm</F> I didn't</SC> <F>er</F> so <.></.> <R>she</R> she was <.></.> <F>uhm</F> not <F>urr</F> suitable for this tour. So <R>I'd like to</R> <F>urr</F> <.></.> I'd like to hear the explain.</B>
<A>I see. O K. We will check the tour conductor, and talk to her. Yes. O K? Would that solve the problem?</A>
<B><.></.> Solve?</B>
<A>Is that all then?</A>
<B><.></.> O K. Yeah.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>It</OL> is almost all.</B>
<A>Right. O K. We're very sorry to cause you a trouble. O K. And we'll <?>cut off the person's</?> charge.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. Thank you very much. O K. Thank you. Has this ever happened to you? <F>Urm</F> <SC>did you</SC> when you traveled, did you have any troubles?</A>
<B><F>Urrr</F> <.></.> sometimes. <F>Urm</F>. <.></.></B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B>It's over?</B>
<A>Yes. This is the end of the role play. I'm sorry. Yes. It's the end of <OL>the role play</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>. Yeah. <F>Urm</F> <SC>I</SC> <F>urm</F> <.></.> last summer, I have <F>er</F> joined the <.></.> <F>urr</F> tour <F>um</F> <R>in Germany</R> in Germany. And <.></.> German students organized the <F>err</F> whole tour so, <F>er</F> it was pretty nice, and I enjoyed myself. But, <F>ur</F> <.></.> sometimes, <F>urr</F> <SC>it is</SC> <F>urr</F> what <F>er</F> foreigners would like to see or go to sightseeing is different from what they would like to show.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>.</A>
<B>So for example, <.></.> <SC>there is</SC> <F>urr</F> <.></.> <F>uhm</F> <F>er</F> <R>where</R> <F>urr</F>, where we go is different from <F>um</F> <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> what the <.></.> guidebook recommend. For example, if there is one city and tour, <F>urm</F> guidebook recommend to go to some <F>urr</F> <.></.> sights, historical sight, very important sights. But, <F>urr</F> <F>urr</F> German students would like to show <F>urr</F> <.></.> <SC>industrial</SC> industry or something.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>So</SC> but <SC>we are not so in</SC> <F>uh</F> as for me, I'm <??></??> Japanese, Maybe almost all of Japanese <??></??> that kind of <F>urr</F> industry.</B>
<A>Right. Then what do you think you could have done to solve that problem?</A>
<B>Sorry?</B>
<A>What could you have done to solve that problem?</A>
<B><F>Urrm</F> <.></.> I couldn't do almost <F>urm</F> anything. But <.></.> <SC>I <F>hmm</F> asked them to</SC> <.></.> <F>uhm</F> maybe <R>I have</R> <SC>I have</SC> <.></.> I should have <F>er</F> check where to go <.></.> in the <??></??> or homepage or so.</B>
