<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>er</F> as American people. <SC>And</SC> <?>right</?>, and not so friendly. But <F>mhmm</F> I think <R>they</R> <F>mhmm</F> <R>they think</R> <F>er</F> they think more and deeply.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>When I talk to British people <?>closely</?>, <F>er</F> I can understand what they think. <F>Er</F> I feel <R>they</R> <F>er</F> they have <R>same</R> same spirit as Japanese. I think because <SC>they</SC> <F>er</F> that British is like island</B>

</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Mhmm</F>. O K. Very good. So can you compare the transportation system between the British one and the Japanese one?</A>
<B>Yes. O K. <F>Er</F> transportation. I think <F>mhmm</F> <R>trans</R> transportation in London and Tokyo is <F>er</F> not so different. <F>Er</F> there are so <R>many</R> many subway lines, <F>mhm</F> and we can go anywhere by the subway.

But <F>er</F> <SC>in the British</SC> in Britain, <F>er</F> <SC>we</SC> there are not so many train lines. We can't go <F>hm</F> somewhere. We need cars, some other transportations.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And the time table is not correct and <F>eh</F> <F>er</F> sometimes the trains will be late or the train stopped.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And so I think the <SC>transportation in</SC> yes, Japanese one is better than British one.</B>
</followup>
