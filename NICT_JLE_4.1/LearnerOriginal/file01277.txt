<stage1>
<A>O K. <F>Er</F> my name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have your name, please?</A>
<B>O K. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><OL><?>Good morning</?></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Nice to meet you</OL>.</B>
<A>Nice to meet you, too. How are you this morning?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> fine. But I went out with my friend last night and drank a little bit. So I'm a little bit tired.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really. Do you drink lots?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <F>hmm</F> no, <F>well</F> not really, but <SC>I li</SC> I really like <SC>dry</SC> drinking.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>So where do you usually go to drink?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> it depends on who I go with. <F>Um</F> if I go out with my university friends, we usually go to Aoyama or Shibuya. But when I drink with my <F>um</F> friends from my child's nursery school, we often invite each other to our house.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> really?</A>
<B>Yeah. I cook something and drink there, because we can't bring our kids to <OL>nice restaurants</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>. Right. So you would like to have a party.</A>
<B>Yeah. Once in a while.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>So can you tell me about how to organize a party?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> actually in this case, it's not really a party, because everybody is working and we try to <F>um</F> see each other on weekdays. Because weekends are very important for mothers who work. <SC>So</SC> and <R>it's a</R> it's a very important time for kids to spend with <F>um</F> their father.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So we try to <F>um</F> set up a little party on weekdays.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>um</F> I don't know. I usually go shopping on the previous weekend and buy stuff for the party. And, I don't know, try to cook within an hour, maybe from five o'clock and invite them around six. But everybody brings something.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I don't have to cook everything.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> <OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>O K. Sounds like interesting. O K. So you have a kid. <F>Er</F> can you tell me about your kid?</A>
<B><OL><laughter>Sure</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><F>Um</F> he's five years old. And <F>um</F> he goes to a nursery school from nine to five. And <F>um</F> <F>well</F> recently <R>he</R> he really enjoys playing golf.</B>
<A>Really?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>. I started to play golf maybe six months ago. And the reason why I decided to <F>um</F> start playing golf is because we usually go overseas once a year.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And it's usually a resort area.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And so at a resort area, you either swim or <laughter>play golf</laughter>. <F>Well</F> that's practically it. So I decided to learn how to play golf. And so <R>if</R> <SC>if I play golf</SC> my husband plays golf, so</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>if we go together, why not take our kid together? So <F>um</F> recently decided to <F>um</F> <SC?>making</SC?> take some golf lessons.</B>
<A>O K. Sounds great. O K. So you are a working mother. I guess child rearing is very tough for working mother. And <F>well</F> <SC>do you have</SC> <F>well</F> how do you manage both like working and child's care?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. That's a difficult one. Because <R>I</R> I'm not very good at that. <nvs>smack</nvs> <F>Um</F> what I mean is that if I work, I really want to concentrate on my work. And say, if I have to finish my work around four in order to pick him up at five, sometimes it's very difficult for me, because I just can't, you know, finish work there and go home. I prefer to finish what I'm doing.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>So <F>eh</F> sometimes it's really difficult. But I try to distinguish the time</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>say, from like nine to four, it's my time. And from five <SC>to</SC> onwards until he goes to bed,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>it's his time. And I try to spend as much time as possible with him.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And yeah, it's working. I don't want him to feel lonely.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>So <SC>I</SC> that after five is really important for both of us, I think. <OL><?>Really</?></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Sounds like</OL> you are a great mother.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><laughter>Yeah</laughter></OL>. O K. Thank you very much.</A>
<B>Sure.</B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>Now, <F>er</F> I'm going to show you a picture. O K. Would you describe it to me, please?</A>
<B>O K. <F>Well</F> it's a picture of a ski resort. <F>Um</F> a couple of kids are throwing snowballs like they're enjoying their time. I guess their parents are enjoying skiing. <F>Um</F> yeah, it seems like ordinary <R>ski</R> ski resort. There's <F>er</F> a ski lesson going on. And <R>this</R> this lady in purple seems to have a difficult time. She seems to be a beginner. <??></??> And there are two couples in a lodge having <R>a</R> a cup of coffee. Yeah. That's about it.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So <F>um</F> you said that <SC>you</SC> <F>um</F> <SC?>as</SC?> <?>so</?> you started to play golf. But <F>well</F> how about winter? In winter do you <SC>als</SC> <F>well</F> play golf or do you do any winter sports?</A>
<B><CO>I don't do any winter s</CO>. <SC>I don't</SC> actually I don't like sports in general.</B>
<A>Really?</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. <F>Um</F> I guess I could ski. But <F>er</F> it's not one of my favorites. So <F>er</F> maybe I go once a year or maybe once in two, three years.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I really don't go skiing. <F>Um</F> but <F>well</F> <R>li</R> like you said, in wintertime it's <SC?>ss</SC?> difficult to play golf, so <SC>what I go</SC> what I do is go to <R>a</R> a <F>um</F> golf range and practice. <F>Er</F> and prepare for the summer.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F> I'm sorry. I don't really enjoy sports.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> really. Are there any reason that <SC>you don't</SC> you are not so interested in sports?</A>
<B>I guess it's <SC>bits</SC> because I'm not <laughter>good at it</laughter>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Ever since I was a child, <F>um</F> my P E grades weren't so good.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><laughter>And</laughter> <F>um</F> you know, like in Japan, <F>um</F> you have P E lessons and you have to <F>um</F> do certain things. Right? But I spent my elementary school days in <F>er</F> the States. And we did have P E class but it was not like a team sport. So we did like kick balls or soccers or basketballs.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. It's not like we had to run within a certain time-type P E class. So <F>um</F> <SC>i</SC> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I really didn't have to try even though I wasn't really good at it. Right? And <SC>think <F>um</F> that made me</SC> <F>er</F> yeah, I guess that's why I never continued to <F>um</F> do any sports for a long time.</B>
<A>Right. I can imagine how you felt.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. Thank you very much.</A>

<A>Now, O K, let's try a role-play. O K. Please read this card. And when you are ready, just let me know.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Er</F> hi, may I help you, ma'am?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Um</F> I bought this <F>um</F> sweater <F>er</F> for my husband the other day and I brought it home. Actually it was a Christmas gift.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> and <F>er</F> he tried it on and it was a bit small for him, so I want to exchange it <F>um</F> with a larger size.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I'm sorry. <R>We can't</R> we can't do that.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <F>well</F> <F>um</F> when I bought this at your shop maybe like week ago, <F>um</F> there was a shop attendant.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> he was with me and <R>I</R> I told him that this could be a bit small.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> <SC>I want to</SC> I might have to change it. And I asked him if it's possible to do that and he said yes. So that's why I bought this. And I even called from home two days ago and asked one of your staff that <SC>I wan</SC> if I could exchange it and they said yes, so I brought it here.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> maybe the person you talked to <F>er</F> is a manager of this shop. But <OL>sorry</OL></A>
<B><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.</B>
<A>I am a part-time worker here.</A>
<B>I see.</B>
<A>And <F>eh</F> <F>eh</F> <F>uh</F> now he is out of town in business trip.</A>
<B>I see.</B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> when will he be back?</B>
<A><F>Um</F> he'll be back in one week.</A>
<B>In a week. O K. <F>Um</F> then I'll call back after a week. Maybe next Tuesday.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> is it O K? Isn't that a gift for your husband?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> yeah. But it's already January so <SC?>we</SC?> <?>wouldn't</?> hurt.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>It's all right</OL>.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you for your patience.</A>
<B>O K. Thank <OL>you so much</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K, please</OL> come back.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Thank you very much.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. So <F>er</F> you told me that you were spending your time in America <OL>a long time ago</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>And are there any differences like what about shopping in America and shopping in Japan?</A>
<B>In general?</B>
<A>In general.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <nvs>smack</nvs> <F>well</F> <.></.> I guess the price is really different.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>For example, if I go to the States or some <F>er</F> other countries, I often go to shopping malls <F>um</F> and try to buy some stuff on sale.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>um</F> <R>o</R> obviously there's like a winter sale or summer sale in Japan as <F>well</F>. But it's usually like fifty percent off or twenty percent off. But for example, if you go to Macy's,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter>in California</laughter>, it's like thirty percent off, and another twenty percent off and another fifty percent off, you know. They just wanna get rid of it. So it's basically like seventy to eighty percent off. And I'm always wondering if they can make any profit from that. But <F>um</F> you know, <R>that</R> that's really different. And I guess the shop staff's attitude is a bit different, I guess. <SC>They</SC> in the States, they leave you alone. And you just have to bring your stuff to the cashier. But in Japan, they try to attend you and try to help you out when you don't need any help.</B>
<A><OL>Right, yeah</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So I</OL> think that's a bit different.</B>
<A>So where do you think the difference come from?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> which difference?</B>
<A><F>Uh</F> like <F>well</F> their staff attitudes or the prices.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I guess <F>well</F> <R>i</R> <F>er</F> in terms of their attitude, I guess it's <SC>their</SC> <F>um</F> how much they're willing to work, you know.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> in the States, most of the places, <R>they</R> <F>um</F> they have like, <F>uh</F> I don't know, certain time from nine to five and their salary depends on how much they sold or not, because at the cashier, they often type in their name for the record or something. So <F>um</F> I guess <SC>they basically don't try</SC> they don't have to try hard, you know, in other words <F>um</F> <SC>they don't have to</SC> <F>er</F> they just have to do what they have to do, not extra work. But in Japan, <SC>they</SC> you try to <F>um</F> be a good staff, you know. And if you're good staff, you try to offer good service or you try to offer some help. But <SC?>in</SC?> <F>um</F> for people in the States, I guess that's not very important. <SC>What they</SC> what's important is working from nine to five, say. And getting a certain amount of salary is important. So I guess the quality of service,</B>
<A><OL>Yes</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><?>it</?> is</OL> not so important.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>I totally agree with you.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much.</A>

<task>
<A>Now finally, I'm going to show you this picture. And now I'd like you to make up a short story about this picture. And the story happened <F>er</F> last week. So please start <SC>with</SC> <F>er</F> your story with "One day last week".</A>
<B>O K. <F>Um</F> one day last week, a man was driving his car. <F>Um</F> he was going to his friend's place <F>er</F> for a party. And from the other side, there came <SC>a mo</SC> <F>er</F> a young guy driving a motorbike. And he was talking to his girlfriend on the cellphone. And because he was talking to his girlfriend on the cellphone, he wasn't watching where he was going. And he bumped into <F>um</F> this car and dropped his cell phone and broke it. <F>Um</F> <nvs>smack</nvs> at first this young guy on the motorbike complained that it's this other guy's fault that he broke his cellphone and his motorbike. But <F>um</F> <SC>this guy</SC> <?>guess</?> I should have named him, <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>this guy <F>um</F> didn't agree to this young man. So they decided to call the policeman. And they explained the situation to the policeman. And the man on the car claimed that <F>er</F> it's not his fault that this accident happened. <F>Um</F> so I guess <SC>they decided to</SC> <F>er</F> I don't know, maybe they decided to talk about it some other day, because this man on the car was in a rush. And <F>um</F> the guy on the motorbike called the truck and asked them to tow away his <F>er</F> motorbike and repair it.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. So if you were this police officer, what <R>woul</R> would you say to the both of <F>er</F> them?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> so <R>it's</R> <SC>it's really not</SC> <F>um</F> it's really both of them's fault. <F>Um</F> in a car accident, you never can be hundred percent good or hundred percent bad. And so <F>um</F> I think this guy on the motorbike <F>um</F> <F>er</F> is <SC>worse'n</SC> worse than this guy on the car.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So maybe he has to pay eighty percent. <F>Um</F> and this guy on the car has to pay twenty percent of this whole mess. But <F>oh</F> sorry. That's not policeman's <F>er</F> <laughter>job</laughter>. <F>Um</F> <F>ooh</F> <SC>I would just</SC> if I were this policeman, I would just <F>um</F> listen to what they have to say and so I have to <?>have</?> to make some documents.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And what they should do or want to do after that depends on the insurance company.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> right. O K.</A>
</followup>
</stage4>
<stage5>
<A>Thank you very much. Now we've come to the end of the interview.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Well</F></OL> do you have any plans after this?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> yeah, I have some work to do after this. So <F>um</F> I might go home and finish up my work.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> O K.</A>
<B>But it's a nice day today. <OL>So</OL></B>
<A><OL>Yeah</OL>.</A>
<B><F>um</F> might be a good day to <F>um</F> go shopping,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>maybe.</B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B>Or I have a cup of <F>er</F> coffee outside.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>So thank you very much for coming in such a nice weather.</A>
<B>Yeah. Thank you.</B>
<A>Let's have <OL>a nice</OL> day.</A>
