<A><OL><CO>What</CO></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>Psycholo</R></OL> <.></.> psychologically, also.</B>

<A>Or special case?</A>
<B><..></..> <CO>I</CO>. <..></..></B>
<A><SC>Why you</SC> why did you miss the train?</A>

<A>Can you tell me a bit more about what you did together?</A>
<B><.></.> What I did together? <.></.> <F>Uhmm</F>. <.></.> I talked a lot because <R>the</R> the <R>place</R> <.></.> place she lives in <R>is</R> <.></.> is very <.></.> rural and away from the city because <R>the <.></.> department</R> the department she belongs to <R>is</R> <.></.> is located in that. So <SC>I didn't</SC> <SC>I couldn't do anything <.></.> without</SC> I couldn't anything but talk with her or walk around the field.
