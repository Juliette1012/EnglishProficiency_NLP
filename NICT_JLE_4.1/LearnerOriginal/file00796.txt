<task>
<A>O K. So first thing today, please look at this picture. And please describe this picture.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Uum</F>. It seems to be a <F>er</F> high school class <F>er</F> in suburb of Tokyo. <F>Er</F> <F>err</F>. And a teacher is teaching mathematics. But <SC>none of them</SC>, <F>er</F> maybe <F>er</F> most of them are listening to her. And only one boy is listening to her <F>er</F> eagerly. But other person <F>er</F> are just chatting or <F>urm</F> drinking something or <R>ma</R> maybe <F>er</F> <F>err</F> sending the e-mail <R>to</R> to friends or <F>ur</F> chewing gum. And then <F>er</F> this class <SC>seems to be a</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> seems <SC>to be</SC> not to be very good class.</B>
<A>O K. All right.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So please <F>er</F> compare this class situation with <F>er</F> the days in your high school days.</A>
<B><SC>In my high school days, <R>it's</R> <F>err</F> it's quite different from</SC> <F>er</F> my high school days is quite different from <R>this</R> this class.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>Because <F>ur</F> <SC>the</SC> first of all, <SC>I ha</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>we have a</SC> we had a <SC>uniform</SC> school uniform. So everybody was wearing the same <F>er</F> navy <F>um</F> <F>ee</F> school uniform. And also <F>err</F> the teacher was very strict. And <SC>the te</SC> our teacher didn't allow us to <SC>do some</SC> do <F>er</F> some kind of <F>er</F> e-mail stuff because first of all, I didn't have mobile phone when <laughter>I was</laughter> high school. and also <F>err</F> our teacher didn't allow us to chat with my friend. And <F>er</F> we are not allowed to bring any food or drink in a class room at all.</B>
<A><F>Uum</F>.</A>
<B>And it's quite different. And also <SC>hair</SC> their hair style is very different from us.</B>
<A>I see. O K. Thank you.</A>
</followup>
</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A>So let's try a role-play now. Please read this card. And when you are ready, I will begin.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading a card and thinking for a while.</ctxt>
<A>Ready?</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K. This is a telephone conversation. <OL>O K</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A>Trun-trun. Hello. A B C travel.</A>
<B>I'm sorry <R>I</R> <F>um</F> I have some question regarding the tour I joined <F>err</F> <F>um</F> three days ago.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B><F>Err</F> <F>um</F>. <R>Do</R> <SC>do you</SC> <F>um</F> <.></.> would you just tell me why <SC>that</SC> <SC>the</SC> our hotel rooms were not ready at that time? Because <F>err</F> when we arrived at the hotel, <SC>the</SC> our tour leader told us that our hotel room <SC>was</SC> <R>were</R> were not ready yet. And I have to wait for hours.</B>
<A><F>Uum</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>err</F> I don't know <R>what kind of</R> <F>err</F> what kind of <F>err</F> agent you are using <R>at</R> <F>er</F> <SC>at the</SC> <.></.> <F>err</F> in Hawaii.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> <F>uum</F>. We haven't heard anything like that. So I think it's just a problem in the hotel.</A>
<B>Now but <F>er</F> <SC>if it's</SC> the problem of the hotel <F>err</F> <F>err</F> <R>we</R> we can understand, but I've heard that <SC>hotel was</SC> that hotel person was saying our tour <R>lead</R> leader that <F>er</F> <F>er</F> they can not find our names on the <SC>list</SC> <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> you know, reservation list. So I thought there is some kind of mistake <R>between</R> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> between the <F>er</F> hotel reservation and the local agent, I think.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. That's terrible.</A>
<B>And that <R>made</R> made us to <R>wait</R> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> wait at the hotel for hours. And <SC>the</SC> <F>err</F> <R>we</R> <F>um</F> <R>we</R> <R>we lost our</R> <F>um</F> we lost our time to go to shopping.</B>
<A><F>Uum</F>.</A>
<B>So <.></.> I think <F>err</F> <F>uum</F> <.></.> your <SC>agent</SC> local agent is not so good.</B>
<A><F>Uum</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>err</F> it's not only this case. <F>Err</F>. <SC>Because</SC> <F>um</F> and also in the <F>err</F> <R>f</R> <F>er</F> flier, <SC>we ha</SC> we could have a <SC>good</SC> <F>err</F> very gorgeous dinner, but <R>the</R> the content of dinner was not so good.</B>
<A><F>Uum</F>.</A>
<B>And the quality of the food was very bad. And <F>ur</F> we paid a lot of money on this tour, but <F>er</F> <F>er</F> it's seems like a very very cheap <R>inex</R> inexpensive tour.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. What should I do?</A>
<B>I think <F>um</F> <F>uum</F> frankly speaking, I want you give me some money back.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Ur</F> I need to talk to my manager. Can you wait?</A>
<B>O K. <CO>So when <R>can I</R> <OL>can I</OL></CO>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ur</F> in ten</OL> minutes, I'll call you.</A>
<B>In ten minutes.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>All right. Sorry for trouble. O K. Thank you. This is the end of the role-play.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Have you ever had any problem when you were traveling abroad?</A>
<B><..></..> Problem?</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. Yes. <R>I have</R> <F>er</F> <SC>I have a</SC> <F>er</F> I had a trouble <R>wi</R> <F>uum</F> with my <F>er</F> the <SC>car</SC> rental car. I rent a car in Australia.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B>And that the car <F>err</F> was not so in a good condition. So when I was <SC>tr</SC> <F>um</F> driving, <R>the</R> the inside of the car, I smell something burn.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uum</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> I think like <F>er</F> <R>s</R> something is burning and so like <F>er</F> smoky inside.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>So I called the <F>ur</F> rent a car company, and I asked them to change the car.</B>

And then after <R>train</R> train passed through <F>um</F> <R>briefca</R> briefcase <R>was</R> <F>er</F> was there as it was.

<A>Really?</A>
<B>Before <R>I ha</R> I have no experience that I talk to them or I asked them to do something. So <R>I</R> <SC>I don't know</SC> I can not say anything about them.</B>
