<B><laughter>Thanks</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Does it have a special meaning?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F> not really. It's just that my parents had to choose a name <SC>just</SC> that started with an M.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><laughter>Because</laughter> both their names start with M. So and it's possible to like pronounce it <nvs>sniff</nvs> in English as <F>well</F> as in Japanese.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Oh</F> I see. So now, <F>urm</F> it's really freezing outside.</A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>
<A>Do you like this season?</A>
<B>I hate it. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>Because I used to live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, and <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is like sunny weather all year.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And winter doesn't get really cold like this.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>It just rains a lot. It never snows.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>So I hate it. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><CO>So how long <SC>did you</SC> have you lived</CO>?</A>
<B>I lived in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> for <F>urm</F> eleven years.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And</OL> then <F>ur</F> did you speak any Japanese?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> yeah. <F>Ur</F> with my mom.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>But</OL> it wasn't like at the level my Japanese at right now.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>It</OL> was more like childish kind of,</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>yeah. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>So did you have any problems when you came back here?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yeah. Because I couldn't read any Japanese.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>So <SC>I star</SC> I actually learned <JP>hiragana</JP> and <JP>katakana</JP> like when I came here,</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>which was like two years ago. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><laughter>So</laughter> it was really tough just adapting to the classrooms</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Because</OL> I wouldn't be able to take notes and stuff like that. So I had to look at the blackboard to see <laughter>scribbles</laughter>. <laughter>It didn't</laughter> look like words to me.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>So now, what about now? It's <SC>ea</SC> better? <OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah, it's</OL> a lot better. I like learned a lot since I've come here. It's just that when you surround yourself with people that speak a certain language, <SC>you just like</SC> because I'm young, it's like, you just tend to adapt it easily.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>So I don't know. I just kind of caught on. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Good. Good. So now, <F>urm</F> after school, what do you do usually?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I'm in the strings club. So I play cello.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ur</F> when I don't have my clubs, <SC>I usually go to</SC> I just go home and go on the Internet. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Right. Right. So how did you get interested in <F>ur</F> playing <F>ur</F></A>
<B>Cello?</B>
<A>cello?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I don't know. I just actually like this <??></??> because <F>urm</F> <SC>I</SC> one of my favorite directors is Alfred Hitchcock.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> in his movies, like <SC>you'll s</SC> you'll notice that a lot of <F>um</F> background music would involve cellos just <F>ur</F> express the sound of like, the eeriness or the creepiness of this <??></??> scene.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>So I got interested in that, and then so since I came here I learned that you could learn the cello. So</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>I said, "Hey.". <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>.</A>
<B><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</B>
<A>That's good, good. <F>Mm</F>. So <F>urm</F> on weekends, what do you do usually?</A>
<B>Usually, <F>ur</F> not <laughter>much</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>I don't know. Like I have to study, and then I read lots of books because I don't know,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><R>I'm ju</R> I'm just trying to keep up with my English. <CO>Because I can</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Ohh</F>.</A>
<B>Because <R>once</R> once you come here, <R>you</R> you just don't use it as much so</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>the best way to keep up your English is to read books and <OL>talk with other</OL> people.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> that's what I'm trying to do.</B>
<A>So which book do you like to read?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> I <SC>just</SC> actually have it in my bag like right now. <laughter>I have</laughter> <F>urm</F> "Cats Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>It's really good. <R>It's</R> <F>urm</F> it's like sci-fi and it's about like the end of the world or something like that.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And I like a lot of like sci-fi books. Yeah. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. So what's so good about it?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I don't know it's just kind of break from reality.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><SC>It's</OL> just not</SC> <R>you</R> you know it'll never happen because it's about like semi-chemicals and like how they make all the oceans into ice, and stuff like that.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>But</R></OL> but in a way, it kind of scares you because maybe that is what the world's gonna be like in the future.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><laughter>So</laughter> yeah, <?>virtually</?>.</B>
<A>That's good. Good.</A>

Yeah. <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> it seems like <SC>she's trying to teach like the math</SC> and she's trying to teach the math but they're just <?>tend to</?> be bored. So like one guy's looking out the window, he's like blowing bubbles. And the other people are talking and stuff like that.

<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>

<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL> O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So now, please compare <R>the</R> <F>ur</F> the classrooms</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>in that picture to</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A>the one when you were in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</A>
<B>When I was in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. <F>Well</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> I don't know, I went to a private school, and then it was a pretty strict private school.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>So I don't think anyone would</SC> because you're not allowed to chew gum. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><laughter><?>But</?> so</laughter>, <SC>ch</SC> gums are not allowed on campus so no one would be chewing gum.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><SC>And like</SC> and cell phones. We didn't have cell phones much <OL><?>tell you the truth</?>, because</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>like cell phones here are very fads because they have color screens.</B>
<A>Right, right.</A>
<B>And they have this you can do so much on them. But over there, it's like tiny thing, black and white <??></??>. All you can do is call. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>They didn't even have like messages back then. <R>So</R></B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>so you never find a girl like <SC>own her</SC> own a cell phone like this.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And then I don't know, otherwise it looks quite the same except <F>well</F> the guy <R>li</R> listening to music.</B>

<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>and schools here is that in <F>ur</F> my schools, you would be able to choose. So <SC>you'd have like</SC> you'd have to wear a white top or white shirt,</B>

<B>All right. <F>Ur</F> one day last week, two sisters named Julia and Maria decided to go out camping because it was such a nice weather. So they packed up their car with <SC>all their belongings</SC> it's like not all their belongings, but just normal camp things like <F>ur</F> things for barbecue and a package tent so that they could pop it up. Once they arrived at the place, which was, I think, national park, they decided to put up their tent and got their stew ready. And did just fine till they felt drops of rain coming down on them. And so Julia panicked saying, "<F>Oh</F> my God, there's a storm coming.". <SC>And she ss</SC> and then the other sister were like, "<F>Oh</F> no, it's all right. I think we'll be O K," until huge cast of rain came. It was actually a storm. So all their things, the tent's blown away including <R>all the</R> all the barbecue things. So they rushed into their car <nvs>sniff</nvs> and drove away while lightning is coming down on them. And then they just happened to pass by a hotel. And they decided, "<F>Well</F> since we can't go camping tonight, why don't we just stay at this hotel since we can't <laughter>go home</laughter>.". And so they stopped by at the hotel and had a quiet evening unfortunately in a hotel instead of enjoying the great outdoors. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
