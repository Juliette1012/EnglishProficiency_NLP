<B>O K. <F>Uh</F> a woman teacher is just teaching, probably I think this is math class. <SC>Students</SC> one, two, three, four, five, six, six students are just listening and <SC>taking the classes</SC> <F>uh</F> taking the class. One student in front of the teacher <R>looks</R> looks serious <R>taking</R> <F>er</F> taking notes, looking at boards. I think he is listening to her very <F>well</F>. But rest of them <SC>looks not good</SC> look not good. <F>Um</F> <SC>the girl</SC> <SC>one of the girl</SC> one of the girls is just <F>mm</F> sending probably E-mail to her friends, I think. And one of the <SC>boy</SC> boys is just looking <SC>arou</SC> outside the window and chewing gums. This is not good as <F>well</F>. And one of the boys just <R>drinking</R> drinking probably juice and listening to music while taking class.

<A><OL>Yeah</OL>.</A>
<B>University. Is that O K?</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B>O K. This university, I think, is very small. I think <R>one</R> one year is just, I don't know, probably five hundred students or something. But compared to that, <F>mm</F> <H pn="school name1">XXX04</H> University is just so large. And I think, I don't know, probably <F>uh</F> <R>I</R> I've heard <F>er</F> <SC>two hundred thousand</SC> <?>I should know</?>, <F>hm</F> <F>hm</F> no, twenty hundred.

And in here, <SC><H pn="school name2">XXX05</H> University</SC> <F>um</F> majority of <H pn="school name2">XXX05</H> University students are Japanese, of course. <SC>Several of them</SC> I mean, yeah, <R>some</R> sometimes we can see foreigners but not so many. But <R>in</R> in <H pn="school name1">XXX04</H> University, you can see <SC>lots</SC> many, many kinds of people. You can see Indians, <R>Fren</R> French people, <F>er</F> people from Italy, I guess, because they are speaking in <OL>Italian, I think</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><SC>And</SC> <R>y</R> yeah, and Chinese. So many Chinese are there. And Cantonese.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. Vietnamese. Yeah. Lots of Vietnamese there. Not so many Japanese there.</B>
