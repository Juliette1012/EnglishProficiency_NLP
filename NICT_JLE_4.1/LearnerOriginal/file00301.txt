<A><F>Uhm</F>. So, could you tell me about your job?</A>
<B>O K. I have been teaching English to the students of junior and senior school.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ur</F> I have been working in one of the private schools in Tokyo for about <laughter>nearly twenty years</laughter>. And I think I like my job</B>

<B>I do have some difficulties, of course.</B>
<A><F>Urr</F>. Can you tell me one of the difficulties?</A>
<B>O K. I'm in charge of the senior two students right now. And, when they were junior one students, one of my students <F>urr</F> <.></.> escaped from <.></.> her home <OL>in the middle of night</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>And <SC>she wa</SC> <F>urr</F> <.></.> her parents didn't know where she was. And <F>ur</F> that was the big problem.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. You know what happened?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. We talked with her parents, and we talked with herself, too. But <F>er</F> we couldn't find any good solution. So she quit our school when she was in <.></.> junior three student.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. <F>Wow</F>. It's a serious problem.</A>
<B>Yes, it was.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. So, how do you release your stress <.></.> <OL>from your job</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Urrm</F></OL>. That's one of the biggest problems I've got <OL><laughter>at the moment</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>So I sometimes <F>urr</F> <R>go to</R> <.></.> go to see <F>ur</F> Kabuki play or <??></??> concerts</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>and <.></.> something like that.</B>
<A>Kabuki?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. What's especially <.></.> good about Kabuki?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. First of all, the clothes of Kabuki players are really really beautiful to see. And <F>ur</F> I could be <.></.> immerse into the Japanese old time. <.></.> <CO>So</CO>. <F>Uhm</F>. <.></.></B>
<A>So, how did you get interested in Kabuki?</A>
<B><.></.> I don't remember it <OL>well</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>. O K. All right. O K. So, on weekends, besides going to see Kabukis, what do you usually do?</A>
<B><F>Urrr</F>. What do I usually do? I don't know, <F>urm</F> <.></.> because I don't always monitor myself. <CO>So</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Sometimes, I listen to music.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>I love pop music and the rock music. So my favorite group is U TWO.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> I'm really glad to see the Grammy Award's results.</B>
<A><F>Ahhh</F>. O K. I did not <laughter>catch up with that news</laughter>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Can you tell me more about U TWO?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. The lyrics of the songs are really <R>socia</R> social ones. So <.></.> that's why I love them. And <R>the</R> the melody itself is appealing to me.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. What do you mean "appealing"?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. What do you mean? <F>Urr</F>. <.></.> <R>Their</R> <.></.> their melodies, <F>urm</F> <JP>nan daro</JP>, let me do my work</B>

</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. So, first thing today, please look at this picture. And, please describe this picture.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. <.></.> The teacher is teaching mathematics to the students. But <F>urr</F> <.></.> very few students are listening to her. And one of the students is chewing a gum. And <F>urr</F> the other student is <.></.> <F>urr</F> using <SC>cell phones</SC></B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>cell phone. And <F>ur</F> one of the boy students <.></.> is listening to music and drinking somethings. And two of the girls are chatting with each other, and they're not attending <.></.> class. <F>Mm</F>. <SC>And also</SC> <.></.> but <SC>the teacher didn't</SC> <F>urm</F> the teacher doesn't seem to pay any attention to the students,</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B><.></.> I think.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>And</SC> but only one boy student is eagerly <F>uh</F> listening to her. <.></.> He's really <.></.> a studious student,</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B><.></.> maybe.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. O K. So, what do you think of this teacher's attitude?</A>
<B><.></.> I don't think her attitude <SC>is not</SC> is good.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>Because <F>urr</F> <.></.> probably she <.></.> is a little bit nervous, and, <F>er</F> probably her experience is not so <.></.> much. So she doesn't know how to control the students.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <SC>she should <.></.> ha</SC> she should get more experiences.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>. So, what would you do if you are teaching to these children?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <.></.> <F>Urm</F>. Probably, <.></.> <SC>at the very first</SC> in the very first lesson, I would ask the students <F>ur</F> what kind of <.></.> mathematical points they're interested in. And, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>we ask</SC> <F>urm</F> <.></.> <F>ur</F> probably, I will <.></.> get to hints to teach those kinds of students <.></.> by asking a lot of questions.</B>
</followup>
</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>. I see. <.></.> O K. All right. Thank you. <F>Well</F>. Very good point. O K. So, next, we'd like to try a role play.</A>

<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>urr</F> I really <SC>liked it</SC> <SC>liked them</SC> liked it, <F>ur</F> when I bought it. But, once I <.></.> came back home, and I put on the suit, I didn't like it. So I would like you to exchange another one.</B>
<A>That's not a good reason.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>You liked it, but, now, you don't like it?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. Yes. <R>I</R> <F>urr</F> <.></.> I didn't check any details when I bought it. <SC>So</SC> <F>urm</F> <.></.> but you recommended it to me, <.></.> saying, <F>urm</F> "It's really good suit.".</B>
<A>That's true.</A>
<B>So I bought it. But, <F>urm</F> when I checked it at home, <F>urm</F> <.></.> size doesn't fit me well.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>Also the zipper doesn't work well.</B>
<A><R>Wha</R> what you mean the zipper doesn't work well?</A>
<B><F>Urrm</F>. <SC>The</SC> <.></.> <R>it doesn't wo</R> it doesn't work, <F>urr</F> 'cos <R>I</R> I couldn't close the zipper. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Ohh</F> <F>urr</F>. O K.</A>
<B>And also, the hem <F>er</F> <SC>doesn't</SC> <.></.> <F>er</F> isn't fit. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhmm</F></OL>. But the suit was on sale, and that was our policy. All sales were final.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. I didn't know that. You didn't say that.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>. I don't know what to do. I can't decide.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. Please call the other <.></.> clerk or the manager, please.</B>
<A>All right. <F>Urr</F>. But the manager is out of town, and he'll be back three days later.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Urm</F>. Could I make an appointment to see him?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Sure. So, maybe, you can just come back three days later,</A>

<A>O K. This is the end of the role play. <CO>Is</CO>.</A>
<B><?>It's really good</?>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> So, have you ever had a similar experience like this?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> yeah. Not myself, but one of my <.></.> friends. But I don't remember it <OL>well</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>. Have you ever bought something in a foreign country?</A>
<B><SC>Yes, I do</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>yes, I did</SC> yes, I have.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. Where?</A>
<B>In Australia.</B>

<B><F>Oh</F>. <.></.> Australian shops and Japanese shops? <.></.> In any kinds?</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. <.></.> Any difference.</A>
<B><F>Urrr</F>. <.></.> <F>Oh-oh</F>. <.></.> I can't think <.></.> any particular differences. <F>Uhm</F>. <.></.> <F>Ahhh</F>. <F><?>Well</?></F>. The difference would be <F>er</F> <.></.> the <.></.> sales persons. The Japanese sales persons are eager to sell <.></.> anything.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>urrr</F> <.></.> Australian sales persons <.></.> don't feel like that.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>They seem <F>urm</F> <.></.> relaxing, and, <F>ur</F> before pushing <.></.> the customers <SC>to buy something</SC> <F>er</F> to sell something, <F>urm</F> <.></.> they chat with the customers first.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>And, <F>ur</F> <.></.> first of all, they lets the customers relaxed and <F>ur</F> pleased, and <F>ur</F> <.></.> free to talk anything. And, after that, <.></.> probably, the customers would ask <.></.> <SC>something they want</SC></B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>.</A>
<B>something they're looking for.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>And <.></.> then, the sales persons are ready to sell them.</B>

So his bag was <.></.> safe. And he was really relieved to know that. And, after that, he asked one of the station's clerks. And <R>the</R> <.></.> the person <F>ur</F> <.></.> fell down to the <.></.> rail and <SC>got the bag</SC> <SC>got his bag, and back</SC> <.></.> got it back to him.</B>
