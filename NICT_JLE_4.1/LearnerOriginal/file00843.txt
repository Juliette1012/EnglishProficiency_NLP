<A><F>Hum</F>. I don't know anything about that. Can you tell me about your neighborhood?</A>
<B><SC>Kyodo is</SC> <F>err</F> <SC>it takes</SC> if you take the <R>su</R> subway or train from <H pn="others3">Shinjyuku</H> Station, it take about twenty minutes. And <SC><H pn="others1">Kyodo</H> Station's</SC> <F>er</F> <H pn="others1">Kyodo</H> is <F>er</F> relatively <laughter>sophisticated places</laughter>. And we have some university, <H pn="school name1">Tokyo Agricultural</H> University, so there're quite lots of interesting <F>err</F> stores and shops and good restaurants. <SC>And</SC> but still, it's <F>er</F> for residential area, so it's not so <?>crowdy</?> or industorial place. So it's quite comfortable place to live.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. That's <OL>nice</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.</B>
<A>That's nice. Do you live with your family?</A>
<B>Yes. We recently moved to <H pn="others1">Kyodo</H>, last July, actually, with <SC>our</SC> <SC>my family and</SC> yeah, <SC?>my family's</SC?> my husband and two kids. And they are twins.</B>
<A>Twins?</A>

<A><F>Oh</F> my goodness.</A>

<B><OL><laughter>Thank you</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A>Now, when you <SC>find</SC> found out that you are going to have twins, how did you feel?</A>
<B>Actually, I didn't expect that I was pregnant at all <OL>because</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.</A>
<B>we didn't planned. Or <SC>we</SC> as far as I understand <?>why</?> I feel, <SC>I</SC> we didn't do nothing almost. So it was kind of "Why?". And <R>it's a</R> it's a pleasant surprise, but it was kind of shock. And I didn't really expected anything like that, so I was kind of freezed.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL>, therefore, <R>the</R> the one of the nurse was so worried about my face <SC>and</SC> because I didn't express my happiness or whatever. So she came to me and, "Are you all right?". <F>Er</F>. "<R>Do you</R> <SC>do you wo</SC> <F>err</F> does your <F>err</F> partner knows about this?". And she was very worried about, but, <F>ah</F> yeah, it was O K. <SC>And</SC> but it's a good because it's very, I think, efficient and productive if I have to stop the work</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B>yeah, and deliver the two kids at the same time. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>Right. O K. What's your responsibility at work?</A>
