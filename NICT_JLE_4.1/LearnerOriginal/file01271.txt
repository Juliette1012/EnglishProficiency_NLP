<stage1>
<A>So let's begin. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. Can <OL>I have</OL> your name, please?</A>
<B><OL><F>Um</F></OL>. <F>Um</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>How are you today, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> <JP>san</JP>?</A>
<B>Fine. How are you?</B>
<A>I'm fine, too. Thank you. O K. So <F>um</F> what do you do, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> right now I'm attending at the graduate school and I'm studying <nvs>cough</nvs> English literature.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <F>Er</F> can you tell me a little more about your study?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> sure. <F>Um</F> mainly I study the works of William Shakespeare. And <F>um</F> I'm <F>mm</F> now trying to write my P H D thesis. And if I pass, I'm going to be called Doctor <laughter><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H></laughter> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. <F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I don't know how long that's gonna take, but <nvs>laughter</nvs> anyway.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. And then what do you wish to do?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> hopefully I'd like to get a job at some college or university because I like teaching.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> hopefully I'd like to teach English literature to college students.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. Have you ever taught?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> right now, I'm teaching English language at my university to <F>um</F> sophomores.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <CO>So</CO>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> that's very <F>um</F> challenging because I have about one hundred students</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>in my class.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> It's really hard to keep the students interested</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>when there are so many people in one room.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. How do you manage that?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I speak really loud. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>And <F>er</F> I'm trying to <F>um</F> bring up some topics that may interest the kids more. So I do a lot of research on the Internet.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> I also try to see a lot of movies and <F>uh</F> I try to see a lot of shows on T V</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>to <F>um</F> keep me up-to-date about what's going on inside those young kids minds. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>Great</OL>. O K. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Um</F> then in your free time, what do you enjoy doing?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>well</F> my biggest hobby has always been reading. But right now, reading is sort of <F>oh</F> part of my job, <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>so <F>um</F> I'm not sure if I can call that a hobby any more. I also like going to movies and I like singing. <F>Oh</F> I have this little singing group with my friends.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> and we get together <F>um</F> about two or three times in a month.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And we take a lesson. And right now we're going to <F>er</F> sing at this competition that's going to take place next month.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>um</F> <laughter>yeah, I don't know how</laughter> that's going to turn out. <OL>But</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL></A>
<B>we're trying to.</B>
<A>Can you tell me about <SC>other</SC> the other members in your singing group a little bit?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> they're mainly <F>er</F> my friends from college.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I belonged to the glee club when I was a college student.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And the main members are from there. But there are also some other people that <.></.> didn't sing when they were at college but now they wanna do some <laughter>singing, so</laughter> <F>um</F> they just came in. And so that's my new <??></??>.</B>
<A>I see. How do all of you feel about this up-coming competition?</A>
<B>Very nervous. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><F>Um</F> yeah, but it's gonna be big challenge for us, so we're both nervous and excited.</B>
<A><F>Huh</F>.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. So <F>er</F> firstly today, <F>er</F> I want you to <F>er</F> look at a picture of a classroom. Please describe this picture for me.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Um</F> <R>it's a</R> it's a math class, I think, in an American high school. And <F>er</F> I think the teacher is trying to <.></.> <F>um</F> teach the kids some <.></.> I think it's a equation. <F>Er</F> <SC>some people are trying</SC> some people are paying attention but there are some students who are not really <F>um</F> paying attention to the class. <F>Um</F> I see a girl playing with her cellular phone. So maybe it's a international school in Tokyo or something, I'm not really sure, because this girl is trying to <F>er</F> E-mail a friend on cellular phone. I don't know if that happens in the United States. <F>Um</F> there is a boy chewing gum. And <F>er</F> there's this one student who is listening to music on his Walkman. And of course there are some girls who are, I don't know, <nvs>laughter</nvs> doing their makeups <laughter>and</laughter> talking.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And then out of, one, two, three, four, five, six, six students, I think only one is paying <?>good</?> <laughter>attention</laughter> to the class. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. So <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, did you go to school in the States?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> yeah. For about three years.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. At <F>er</F> <F>uh</F> high school?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><?>Of course</?>. Can you compare <F>er</F> the school you went to in the States with this classroom?</A>
<B><F>Umm</F> yeah. I think <F>um</F> the math class that I went to was more serious <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>than this one.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Because</OL> <F>er</F> when I went to the States, <F>um</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> I was put into this really good math class because I was Japanese and obviously all Japanese are good at math <laughter>when they</laughter> go to the States.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>So <F>um</F> <SC>I</SC> <nvs>cough</nvs> <R>my</R> my classmates in my math class were all very smart.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And they were very <?>studious</?>, so this <R>di</R> did not happen in my math class. But <F>um</F> in my other classes, this sort of thing did happen,</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>like</OL> in my English class or in my history class.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Some people are not paying attention, girls talking, <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><laughter>wearing their</laughter> makeups,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>eating stuff. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>That was very common in my other <OL>classes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. You said that <F>er</F> <SC>where the mostly</SC> <F>er</F> most Japanese students, if they go to the States, they are put into the <?>good</?> level</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>math class, but <F>er</F> <R>wh</R> <R>wh</R> <R>why</R> <F>er</F> why do you think that is the case?</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. I don't know. But <F>um</F> when I look at the American students, <F>um</F> first of all, they use calculators <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><laughter>in their math classes</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And the Japanese students are trained to do their calculations on their own. And <F>er</F> <SC>they were</SC> they are expected to do a lot more <R>in</R> <F>er</F> in Japanese schools. And also <F>um</F> in American schools do people who are good at math are encouraged to do more.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>But</OL> the people who are not so good are just left as they are.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <SC>the expectation</SC> the bottom line is not so high</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>um</F> whereas in Japanese schools, the bottom line is really high. So everyone is supposed to do above this level.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But that level is higher than <SC>that</SC> the level at the States.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. In your <F>er</F> own view,</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>which system is better?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I think at high school level, <F>um</F> I think the American system is better because by that time, <SC>people</SC> most people have already discovered <SC>that</SC> what they are good at and what they are not good at.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But <SC>in</SC> maybe in the elementary school level, I think the Japanese <F>um</F> system is better, because there are some certain things that everyone has to learn.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. O K.</A>
<B><nvs>sigh</nvs></B>
<A>Thank you.</A>

<stage3>
<task>
<A>Then next, let's try a role-play. And this time, please read this card. And if you finish reading, I will begin.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<A>Are you ready?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>Yes, ma'am. May I help you?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I'm sorry. I bought this bag the other day at this store.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> I really liked it when I saw it here. But when I took it home, I'm not sure if the bag went with my clothes and my other things.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>um</F> I was wondering <F>um</F> if you could give me a refund or maybe exchange it to some other item?</B>
<A>I'm sorry. <SC>It's</SC> <F>er</F> exchanging and giving refund is against our policy.</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Um</F> I realize that. And I'm really sorry. But <F>um</F> I haven't really used the bag.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <R>it's</R> it's good as new.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <R>ma</R> maybe if you could stretch your policy <laughter>a little bit</laughter>?</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Um</F> but you bought the bag yourself.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>And so <F>um</F> you should have known at the time when you bought the bag if the bag went</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><R>w</R> <F>well</F> with your clothes <OL>or not</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>, I know. <F>Er</F> <R>i</R> it did go <F>well</F> <F>er</F> with the clothes I was wearing at that time.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>But</OL> <F>er</F> you know, when I took it home, <F>um</F> it didn't really <F>um</F> match my <F>um</F> other things. And <SC>I was really</SC> <F>um</F> <SC>I was wearing</SC> <F>um</F> I think I was wearing a very special dress</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>on that day because <F>um</F> I was on this big date. <laughter>And <F>urm</F></laughter> <F>um</F> I think the bag really went <F>well</F> with my</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>dress that day. But usually I kind of wear <F>er</F> more relaxed clothes.</B>
<A><F>Huh</F>. But <F>er</F> if the bag went really <F>well</F> with that special dress, then maybe you can keep the bag as a special bag. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Yeah. <F>Um</F> yeah, that's true. <F>Hmm</F>. You know, <F>um</F> <.></.> yeah, <R>I think</R> I think you do have a point. <nvs>laughter</nvs> You know, <?>like</?> <R>maybe</R> maybe if I return this bag,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and <F>oh</F> you know, maybe <SC>I will</SC> I'll buy something else</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>that's, you know, almost equal value.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And, you know, if there's some difference, I can pay you that money.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. O K. <F>Well</F> <R>I</R> <F>uh</F> actually I'm just a part-timer here</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>so</OL> I don't know if it's allowed.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. Could you maybe talk to the manager?</B>
<A>O K. <F>Er</F> but he's out of town on a business trip.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> O K. <F>Erm</F> so O K. Why don't you just keep the bag?</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Because <SC>I'll</SC> if I take it home, maybe, you know, I'll stain it or something.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R?>So why don't you</R?></OL> so why don't you keep the bag?</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And I'll give you my phone number.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>um</F> when the manager comes back, maybe he can give me a call.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Then we'll talk.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> maybe he could do that.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. So you will <F>er</F> come back with your bag.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>. Yeah.</B>
<A>All right. So I'll be seeing you.</A>
<B>O K. Sorry about the trouble.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> no problem.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>

<followup>
<A><CO><OL>Have you</OL> ever returned any</CO>. <OL><F>Um</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Um</F></OL> I don't think I have. <F>Um</F> <R>ma</R> maybe like, yeah, I think there was one time that they gave me the wrong size or something.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>um</F> it was really the store's fault. So <laughter><F>er</F></laughter> I had not trouble like going to the store.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>But, you know, this <laughter>person is like</laughter> really selfish. <laughter>And I wouldn't do</laughter> <OL>a thing like that</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>So that was kind of hard.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> <F>um</F> <F>mm</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>What are some important points to choose your clothes?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I probably look for <F>um</F> <.></.> <?>I think</?> you know, if they match my other clothes or like how long I can wear it.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>You know. So I'm trying to get the best out of my money. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Because <OL>I'm not <F>er</F> rich</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

</stage3>
<stage4>
<task>
<A>So one more thing I want you to do. Let's try a story making this time.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> <F>er</F> using these six pictures, please make up a short story starting with "One day last week".</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures.</ctxt>
<B>All right. <F>Er</F> one day last week, I went camping with my friend. And we prepared <nvs>cough</nvs> for the camp and preparing part was really fun. We took the tent and we put all the things we needed in a backpack. And my friend drove a car. And we came to this beautiful mountainside. And first of all, we put up our tent. And we did some cooking for the dinner. And we were planning to eat some curry with rice. And everything was going very <F>well</F> until it started to rain. <F>Er</F> at first <SC>maybe we</SC> we thought maybe we could manage a little rain. But after a while it looked like a storm. And not only the rain, but also the wind <F>er</F> began to blow very strong. And we couldn't stay there any more. Everything was flying all over the place including the curry. <laughter><SC>And</SC></laughter> so <F>er</F> we decided that we should not stay there any more. So we got on the car and <F>er</F> left the place. But as it was already in the evening, <F>er</F> we tried to look for the place to stay. <F>Er</F> so that's when my friend found this small hotel called "Hotel Cosmos". And <F>er</F> we decided to spend the night at this hotel. And we <nvs>cough</nvs> got into our room and we took hot shower. And we were very relaxed and we had some tea. And we could still see the beautiful mountains. But <F>um</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> it looked like a clod. And but it was also very good view <SC>to look from</SC> to look out from the windows. But we were glad that we were not actually in that storm.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> Thank you very much for the story.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Er</F> can you remember <F>er</F> about the last time you did some sort of outdoor activities?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <.></.> I think we did go camping but we didn't stay overnight. We just went to this <F>um</F> place at riverside and we had some lunch. We did barbecue.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> my friend, yeah. I'm not really <R>i</R> into this outdoor thing, but <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>um</F> I have a friend <F>um</F> whose boyfriend is very much enthusiastic about <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>camping and barbecuing <OL>and things</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>And so <F>um</F> he tried to take her to this riverside place but she didn't want to go alone. <OL>So</OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>she <F>um</F> got me into it. And so we were like a group of maybe five or six people.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And we had a good time, I think. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. And <F>er</F> what do you think <F>er</F> in general of outdoor activities?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I think it's fun if someone in your group knows a lot about mountains and rivers.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But I don't think it's very safe if nobody knows <F>uh</F> much about the place or the landscape, because you never know what would happen as in the picture. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. Right. Right.</A>
</followup>
</stage4>
<stage5>
<A>O K. So <F>um</F> I thank you very much. The interview is almost ending. So after this, <SC>you</SC> <F>er</F> what are your plans?</A>
