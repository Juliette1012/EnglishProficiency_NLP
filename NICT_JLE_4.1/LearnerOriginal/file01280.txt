<stage1>
<A>O K. Good afternoon. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. Can I have your name, please?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>May I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Sure.</B>
<A>O K. And how are you today, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Fine, thank you. How about you?</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I'm O K, I guess. <F>Er</F> have you eaten lunch?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> not yet.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Er</F> <SC>you're plan</SC> you're going to go?</A>
<B>Probably yes.</B>
<A>In this area?</A>
<B><F>Hm</F> I think I'm gonna go home first and then relax a little bit. And then maybe I'm gonna cook something for myself.</B>
<A>Bravo.</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. Where is home?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="others1">XXX03</H>? I think I know <R>th</R> the area. <OL><H pn="others2">XXX04</H></OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><H pn="others2">XXX04</H>?</A>
<B><H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. Right.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> yes. I know it. <F>Er</F> <R>what are</R> what are the nice points about living in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B><H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <F>Well</F> <F>um</F> there are so many people living there. <SC>But <F>er</F> not</SC> <F>er</F> <F>hmm</F> <SC>I don't kno</SC> I can't find any good points of living there but it's just a quiet town to live. And then <F>um</F> for example on weekends, <F>er</F> sometimes you have to dress up to go to a convenient store, right? But <F>um</F> it's not that kind of town. So I can wear jersey and then <F>er</F> I don't have to wear a makeup to go out. So it's <F>er</F> very comfortable, in a way, <OL>to live</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>. <OL><CO><?>Imagine</?></CO></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>You don't have</OL> to worry anything at all.</B>
<A>Right. That's your hometown?</A>
<B>It's not my hometown but I'm from <F>er</F> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>.</B>
<A><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
<B><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Right.</B>
<A>There's a connection there. I imagine it's cold in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.</A>
<B>Right. I was born in <F>er</F> January.</B>
<A><F>Whoa</F>.</A>
<B>So my mom gave me this name.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>I see. Now, <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>, I guess it's somewhat bit different from <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><SC>But</OL> could you compare</SC> as a child I guess you were in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>, but could you compare life in <OL><H pn="others3">XXX05</H></OL> and life in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <F>Um</F> it's kind of difficult, because I lived in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> when I was really, really young. <SC>So that time, I think</SC> until I was a high school student, I lived in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. And then, I think <F>well</F> when I have to live in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>, then I have to get a driver's license because <F>er</F> <SC>there are no shopping place that you can</SC> <F>er</F> <F>hm</F> there's no shopping place. And then you always have to <SC>drive a</SC> drive your car to go somewhere. So it's really <SC>unconvenient</SC></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>inconvenient.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>But again, it's really quiet and then I can enjoy nature a lot. Yeah. So but in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>, probably, there are so many people <SC>and then</SC> <F>er</F> everywhere I go. And then <F>er</F> sometimes that makes me <F>er</F> feel uncomfortable.</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Sure</OL> Sure.</A>
<B><OL>But that's O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>You mentioned</OL> relaxing, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL> tell me some of the things you do to relax.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> since I love watching movies and I often watch movies at home. I love to go see a movie in a theater but I don't have time to go.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> these days, I tend to stay home and <F>er</F> watch movies. But the problem is that <F>um</F> I'm tired, working hard. So <F>um</F> I tend to sleep</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>when I <OL>watch movies</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>On talking</OL> of movies, <F>um</F> which movies have you seen recently that was pretty good?</A>
<B>Recently. It's a difficult question.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> <?>really</?>. <OL><?>O K</?></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><SC>I canno</SC></OL> <F>hmm</F> I can't remember but <F>er</F> last one. Probably I saw the "Unusual Suspect". <OL>I think <R>that was</R> that was the title</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Er</F> "<R>Usual Suspects</R> Usual Suspects"</OL>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. Unusual?</B>
<A>Usual.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>Usual.</A>
<B>Suspect.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>Sort of suspense</A>
<B>Right, right, <OL>right, right</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Twist</OL> story.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Er</F> when you decide to rent a video or something, <F>er</F> <OL>how do you</OL> decide which movie to watch?</A>
<B><OL>Right</OL>. <F>Um</F> first of all, usually I ask my friends who knows a lot about movies. And <F>eh</F> if they say <SC>it's</SC> it was a good movie, then I just rent it. So there is no special reason. But sometimes I check the trailer on T V. And then if <.></.> it looks interesting, then I would go see a movie. But <F>hmm</F> again it's kind of difficult.</B>
<A>Good.</A>
<B><OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. First of all today, let me show you a picture.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Now this is a picture of a room. And could you describe this picture for me, please?</A>
<B>O K. So can I start?</B>
<A>Sure. Go ahead.</A>
<B>O K. There is a room of a young girl. And then <F>er</F> <SC>she is</SC> I guess she is using a computer. And then <F>er</F> she is showing something to her pets. But <F>er</F> the pets are sleeping, a cat is sleeping on the bed and then a dog is on the floor. And then <F>er</F> I don't know why she has a typewriter next to computer. Maybe she use both. And then <F>er</F> it's, I guess, nine o'clock. <F>Er</F> probably this is a weekend. So she is relaxing herself a little bit in a room. And then <F>er</F> also the door is open.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. You mentioned <F>er</F> a computer.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> what do you use <SC>the</SC> your computer for?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I usually check E-mails because <F>um</F> <F>uh</F> <SC>I have to check my E-mails to</SC> <F>uh</F> because some people send me some E-mails about my work so I have to check it every night. It's kind of annoying because sometimes I get a lot of E-mail but I'm too busy to check but I have to respond it quickly. <SC>So</SC> but <F>er</F> I think it's useful to use it.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And then sometimes I <F>er</F> buy a ticket</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><SC><R>to</R> to</SC> <F>um</F> I don't know, next month the Yankees gonna come to play. <F>Er</F> so I got a ticket last time</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>er</F> through the Internet. And then it was really convenient. So I think <SC>i</SC> the computer itself, it's a very good tool.</B>
<A>Some people say they can't live without it.</A>
<B>Right. <OL>I guess so</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><SC>How do yo</SC></OL> <R>ho</R> how do you feel about that?</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. I agree with it. <F>Hmm</F>. Because <F>um</F> I usually don't <F>er</F> read newspapers. But when I check the Internet, then I can get all kinds of news from all over the world. So yeah. And then <F>er</F> for example, some of my friends are in United States. And then they wrote me something by E-mail and then, you know, they tell me something big happened over there. And then so <OL><??></??></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mm</F></OL>. O K. O K. Great.</A>

<A><OL>But before</OL> then.</A>
<B>Right. <F>Er</F> there was a big accident happened. So <F>um</F> I was in a hurry. And then that time, I forgot to call you. I was completely out of my mind. And then <F>er</F> I had to go back to my <F>er</F> hometown to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> because my mom <F>er</F> she called me. And then said <SC>she had a</SC> <F>um</F> I don't know, she fell down from stairs. And then <F>er</F> that time, she was in hospital. So I had to go see her.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> yeah. But <F>uh</F> <SC>I</SC> <F>well</F> I understand. I'm sorry for that. I mean <R>yo</R> your father could visit her or some other relative. <R>You</R> you live in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>. <CO>It's</CO>.</A>
<B>Right, right, right. But <F>er</F> since my brother is in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> and then my father, he was away from home. So and then <SC>I think my mom was really worried about</SC> <F>um</F> I don't know, she didn't know what to do. So probably she called me. And then <F>er</F> <SC>she looked very</SC> I mean, she sounded very upset. So.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> I can imagine she was.</A>
<B><OL>I'm sorry</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>But <F>er</F></OL> <nvs>sigh</nvs> we were all pretty upset, too. I mean those people, they haven't seen you for years.</A>
