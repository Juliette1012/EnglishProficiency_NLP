<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>in the college.</B>

<A><F>Hmm</F>. So which did you like better, <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> or <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>?</A>
<B>It's a very difficult question to answer because <F>er</F> <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> and <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> are pretty different in many aspect. For instance, if I <F>er</F> like to enjoy</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>night clubs, <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> is the best place whereas <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> is the best place <R>to</R> to study. Many <SC>ni</SC> good universities. And <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> <R>has</R> has a lot of natures like <OL>mountains and</OL> <SC>s</SC> beautiful beaches.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I think it totally <laughter>depends</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. I see.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. All right. First of all, please look at this picture and please describe this picture.</A>
<B>O K. This is a scene from a classroom. Looks like <F>er</F> a female teacher <F>er</F> <SC>sta</SC> who is standing in front of <R>the</R> the <F>er</F> blackboard is teaching mathematics according to the diagram she writes on the board. And there are <SC>six or seven</SC> more than seven students in the classroom. But <SC>looks like</SC> seems to me that <F>um</F> most of the students are not interested in her lecture. Probably one or two students are listening to what she is saying.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. All right.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So you studied in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. And <SC>you</SC> I think you had experience <F>er</F> going to school in Japan. Can you compare a classroom in Japan with a classroom in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>?</A>
<B>O K. <F>Um</F> my educational experience in the States was the <F>er</F> university level. <F>Er</F> <SC>al</SC> <SC>but</SC> however I also had my college degrees from Japan.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So if I compare the difference between Japanese and American universities, the major difference was that, <F>er</F> in Japan, most of the cases, the <F>er</F> professors or assistant professor, whoever teaching, <SC>are</SC> were the main speakers whereas in the States, <F>er</F> not only teachers or professors but also students are expected to participate <R>in</R> in the discussions.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So from my memories, <SC?>w</SC?> I had more opportunities to speak up in the classrooms.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So what do you thing is a good point of students participating in the class?</A>
<B>I think <F>um</F> in Japan, if I just listen to the lectures, I felt like I understood what was going on but in many cases, it wasn't true. But in the States, <F>er</F> <SC?>dur</SC?> in the classroom, if I had to participate in the conversations or discussions, I had to understand <R>to</R> to be part of it. So <F>um</F> many cases, I realize that speaking <R>or</R> or being part of the discussion was very important</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>to learn something.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. O K. All right. Thank you.</A>
</followup>
</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A>So next, we'll do a role-play. <F>Hmm</F>. Please read this card.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>And when you are ready, I'll begin.</A>
<B>O K. <nvs>sigh</nvs></B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<A>Ready?</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. It's the telephone conversation. Trun, trun. Hello? This is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H> speaking.</A>
<B>Hi, <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. How are you? It's been long time to talk to you.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> listen. I have a bad news for you.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> regarding the party you are organizing this coming weekend,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I was really expected to be there. But unfortunately, my boss from the company</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>called <R>to</R> to ask if I could cover up my colleague's <F>er</F> position. There will be a big events <F>er</F> within my company.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> <SC>my f</SC> my colleague was supposed to take care of it but I think <F>er</F> he has to take care of <SC>her</SC> his <SC>fa</SC> mother who is now sick in hospital.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So I think</OL> I won't be able to come to the party. But will you plan to have another party in the near future?</B>
<A>I don't know. But <SC>the pla</SC> the party was planned long time ago.</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>. <F>Oh</F> yeah. I understand. I was really looking forward to it. <F>Er</F> but if I don't listen to my boss, I might lose my job, which is <laughter>really bad</laughter>.</B>
<A>But is there anybody else who can do that?</A>
<B>Yeah. I <R>alre</R> already talked to several other people in my sections but they have already <nvs>cough</nvs> their family <F>er</F> <F>um</F> plans. And my boss <SC>kno</SC> knew that I just live by myself <F>er</F> and I don't have any kids, so I think I am <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the best person who could cover up my colleague's absence.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. But the party is this weekend. And <R>it's</R> <F>er</F> it's going to start around seven o'clock. So <R>ca</R> can you make a few hours and come to my home?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> I can't really promise you at this moment but <R>it's</R> it's quite possible, maybe. <F>Er</F> as soon as I finish the <F>er</F> company events, I might be able to <SC>come</SC> stop by at the party. But <SC>if</SC> it could be probably at the end of your party. <SC>Wou</SC> if it's O K with you but I can't really promise you.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> but there are many people who are looking forward to seeing you.</A>
<B>I understand. I know it's very sad. And I'd never had this kind of bad occasions before but this is my first time that I have to really ask you to accept my situation.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. So how can I tell my friends?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> tell that <F>eh</F> <SC>I ha</SC> I won't be able to come to your party because of my company's urgent <F>er</F> events that I <SC>ha</SC> somebody has to really take care of.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. All right. So maybe next time?</A>
<B>I truly hope that you'll organize another party and I cross my fingers that there won't be <OL>any</OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>um</F> emergency like this next time.</B>
<A>So do you promise that you will come?</A>
<B>I promise and I tell my boss in advance that I won't be able to <SC>help <R>his</R> his</SC> <F>um</F> help him next time.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. All right. Only this time. But I hope you can find some time to come over.</A>
<B>I hope so, too.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Thank you</OL> for inviting me.</B>

<A>So did you go to a lot of party in the United States?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> sure. Compared to Japan, I think there were more occasions. You asked me if I went to parties but in fact, people came to our place.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>er</F> <F>um</F> I think <F>um</F> it was very common to live with other students, meaning sharing apartment with bunch of other student to save <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the rentals</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>or utilities.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>

<B><F>Er</F> almost every weekend, there were friends of somebody</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>

<A>All right. So lastly, there are six pictures from one to six. And please make up a story based on these six pictures.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And</OL> please start your story with "One day last week," because this happened before.</A>
<B>One day last week. O K. I make past sentences. O K. There was a Japanese man <F>er</F> walking to a station around eight o'clock in the morning. He usually <F>er</F> take train to go to his office every morning. And it is probably wintertime <F>er</F> when the temperature is below ten degrees Celsius. So <F>um</F> this is the daily thing he usually <F>er</F> <.></.> does. And like many other Japanese stations <F>er</F> in Tokyo, there are many people waiting at the <F>er</F> station. And <SC>he was</SC> this Japanese businessman was one of the person <SC>who were</SC> who was standing in front of the lines. And there was a couple of Japanese businessmen who are talking to each other. It seems that they are talking into something very seriously. And at one moment, one of the guy who was next to this Japanese man move his arm and it hit this Japanese man's business bag very badly. And as a result, his bag was fallen onto <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the rail. And <SC>it was a ac</SC> it was an accident. And it seems that the guy who hit this Japanese man, let's call him Hiroshi, Hiroshi, <F>er</F> to say "I'm sorry. It was an accident.". And <F>uh</F> people around Hiroshi was also looking at them and wondering what would happen in the next. And since this was a rush hour in the morning, there was a train passing by <R>this</R> this station. This train wasn't supposed to stop. So the conductor on the train didn't have time to stop <R>the</R> <R>the</R> the train <SC>just for this bus</SC> <F>er</F> just for Hiroshi's <F>er</F> bag on the railway. So the conductor had to move on. And everyone was almost screaming that his bag was ran by this train. But few seconds later, after the train passed the station, everybody was relieved to see that <SC?>his ca</SC?> <SC>his bag</SC> Hiroshi's bag was still there without any damages. And everyone was so happy that it wasn't really bad accident. Just his bag lying on the railway. <nvs>cough</nvs> And as soon as the train left the station, <SC>the <nvs>cough</nvs> dor</SC> this person who's working for <R>the</R> the station came down to the railway to pick up Hiroshi's bag and bring it back to him. And everyone was <nvs>cough</nvs> staring at what was going on and see nothing really bad happened. So some of them were even clapping their hands</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>for the happy-end.</B>
<A>O K. All right. Thank you.</A>
