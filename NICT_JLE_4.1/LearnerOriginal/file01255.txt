</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A><F>Urm</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> first thing today, I want you to describe this picture.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Um</F> this is a math class. And the teacher is describing something on the blackboard. But students are not listening. And the person in the first row in the middle is the only person who's listening. And people are just playing or chewing gums and staring somewhere else.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Um</F> do you see any difference in the students' attitude <SC>here</SC> or here <F>uh</F> at your school and your school in the States?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> in the States, people were more attracted to the classes.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>They were listening and they were responding to the teacher's questions.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>And teacher was more like <R>s</R> speaking to the students more. She wasn't like just staring at the blackboard and describing things.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>She tried to attract the students more.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. I see. <F>Urm</F> why do you think the students were more attracted in the States?</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F> like that attitude was <R>diffe</R> different, too. Like the students thought that it was really necessary to <SC>s</SC> listen to the classes. But in here, like people are just like wanting to play around</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>a little more.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>They're just like wanting to have fun than to learn things.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I think that's different.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. And what do you think of that kind of attitude here?</A>
<B>I don't think it's really necessary.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>Like it's really loud in classes and noisy,</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>so I can't concentrate, too.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>It's really important to have fun, too, but I think you have to listen to classes.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see. O K. So thank you.</A>

<B>It was really surprising, too.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. I see.</A>

<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. <F>Well</F> if you were the host in that kind of situation, what would you have done?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> maybe I call someone who wasn't attending to understand why she isn't coming or he.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F> no, no. If you were the host, and you were planning to have a party, but your mom had a <OL>stomachache</OL>,</A>
<B><OL><F>Ohh</F></OL>.</B>
<A>what would you have done?</A>
<B>I think I cancelled it because my mom is really important, too. And I can have a party next time, too, maybe <?>for</?> next year.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. <F>Mhm</F>. I see. <F>Urm</F> how was the treatment at the hospital at that time?</A>
<B>Treatment.</B>
<A>Was everything smooth?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> yeah. At that time my father wasn't at home so I called him and I called the ambulance. And he did come back earlier so he was the one who got into the ambulance and went with her.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>So I had to stay home. And yeah, and it was really quick though. And she was O K. And my father called me and he said <SC>the</SC> that she was O K. So that was pretty fine.</B>
<A>I see. O K.</A>
</followup>
</stage3>
<stage4>
<task>
<A><F>Um</F> last thing today, I would like you to make a story from picture number one to six. Like this, O K? And I want you to start your story with "One day last week". O K? This is a story that happened before.</A>
<B>O K. One day last week, two girls were planning to go to the camp near the river. They were packing things in their car and <R>they went</R> they went to the place where they held the camp. But it started to rain suddenly. And the winds blowed <R>so ha</R> so hard and the tents were blown away. And it was really impossible to continue the camp. So they went into the car and found a hotel. <SC>And they planned to</SC> and they decided to stay in the hotel rather than to camp outside.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Ur</F> do you enjoy any outdoor sports?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> is tennis included?</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> I used to play tennis when I was in middle school.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>And I like it very much.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> but I like <?>to</?> badminton like I said last time.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>But I still like tennis, too.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. <F>Ur</F> what's the <SC>differnt</SC> most different <F>mm</F> <F>ur</F> about playing tennis and badminton?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> we have to use the wrist more</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>in badminton.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>The shuttle doesn't fly a little higher like if you don't use the <?>really</?> wrist.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And then tennis, if you use the wrist, you injure your arm so badly</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>so you can't use it. And that's the most different thing, I think.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. What about team sports?</A>
<B>Team sports?</B>
<A>Do you enjoy any team sports?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F>. <CO>If you call like the doubles is that a team sport or</CO>?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I guess, in a sense.</A>
<B>Yeah, I used to do it.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>And I still doing <?>the</?> badminton, too.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Urm</F> <F>uh</F> how is singles different from doubles mentally?</A>
<B>Mentally. <F>Mm</F> mentally. In doubles, you have to like think about the other person more. And you have to move according to <SC>the people</SC> the other person's movement. So you have to think more. But you can enjoy the sports more if you have another playing with you, I think.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
</followup>
</stage4>
<stage5>
<A>O K. <F>Urm</F> we're almost at the end of this interview. So you're going to practice this afternoon as well?</A>

<A><OL>Not today</OL>. I see. So it's not everyday?</A>
<B>No. <F>Ur</F> Monday and Thursdays, we don't have practices.</B>

<B>Yeah, they've already quit it.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>And I think they're really having a hard time right now.</B>
<A>Studying?</A>
<B>Yeah. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. <R>So</R> <F>urm</F> so the leader has changed?</A>

<A><CO>Or</CO>?</A>
<B><?>The <F>er</F></?> third graders doesn't come to the club activities like they quit at July or <OL>in June</OL>.</B>
