<A><OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B>say my name is very unusual name.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>How do you feel when everybody said, "<F>Oh</F>. Your surname is unusual."?</A>
<B><F>Well</F>. I like that kind of thing, the odd or rare thing. So</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>it's</SC> to me, it's O K.</B>
<A>O K. So,</A>
<B><CO>I'm</CO>.</B>
<A>how do you explain to those people?</A>
<B><F>Ohh</F>. Always very peculiar name <R>eve</R> even among <F>ur</F> Japanese. My father from one prefecture in Japan, but, still, we don't know <SC>that name</SC> where that name come from.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. I see. <F>Uhm</F>. O K. <F>Well</F> <F>ur</F>. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, what do you do?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. I'm work for <SC>one foundation</SC> one scholarship foundation. I've been working for <F>ur</F> almost <SC>three hours</SC> <F>uh</F> <laughter>three years</laughter> this coming October.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I feel time flys <SC>so</SC> very fast.</B>
<A><F>Urr</F>. What is your responsibility in that foundation?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. <SC>I'm do</SC> <F>ur</F> my work is <SC>assi</SC> kind of assistant work. But I have a lot of thing to do because <SC>there is</SC> there are four people <R>in</R> including me. And only three of them are over fifties. So, <F>ur</F> you know, only I say, young and lady, it's only me. <CO><SC>So <R>they</R> they don't</SC> they</CO>. But it's O K. But they are not so good at dealing with <SC>P Cs</SC></B>
<A><F>Ohh</F>.</A>
<B>Computers. So, like making <SC>one</SC> some documentation, that kind of thing. I do also some like small things, sending documents to <SC>the country</SC> each country.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>That kind of thing take <SC>much time</SC> much more time than you expect.</B>
<A>But, do you like your job?</A>
<B>Yes. Because I can meet people from south east Asia. <SC>We for</SC> we gave scholarship people working for university in their country including Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore and Malaysia, only five nations. So, before <SC>this begin</SC> I begin this work, I haven't been to south east Asia, also haven't met those people from that area. So I have many chance to meet them. Also, found out I feel so <F>mm</F> comfortable to meet them in Asia area <R>than</R> than people in Europe or U S A.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Why is that? <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. I suppose I can <SC>feel</SC> just get relaxed when particularly in speaking English. I don't care much like grammatical thing or that kind of thing. If I speak with people from <F>ur</F> country <SC>their</SC> where <R>na</R> <F>ur</F> <SC>native</SC> <R>mother</R> mother tongue is English, I feel kind of tense. I care much more about grammatical thing. If I make mistake, what can I do?</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Yeah. O K. You must be <R>very</R> very busy, but, in your free time, or, if you'll get free time, what are you going to do?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. Recently, I'm interested in coffee shop. We call it cafe. <R>Now</R> now, I think it's getting popular. <SC>That</SC> <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> I think many cafe shop open in everywhere. Very popular place for young people. The last Sunday, I went to Aoyama, then visited some <SC>coffee shop</SC> cafe and enjoyed talking with my friend.</B>
<A>Good.</A>
<B>I didn't visit <SC>much</SC> <F>ur</F> many shops, <F>ur</F> clothes shops, <??></??> shops.</B>
<A>O K. But you enjoyed talking <OL>on coffee</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A>Good. O K. Thank you.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A><F>Well</F>. Now, I'm going to show you a picture.</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A>O K. <.></.> O K. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, please describe this picture for me.</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>. <.></.> O K. So it shows one small town. <R>There</R> there are many houses, <SC>and</SC> but this picture focus on one house. And there are several people doing each activity. <SC>One</SC> there's one girl that play jumping with ropes. And there are ladies who are chatting each other, they must be neighbors, and one lady has her dog. <SC>They</SC> <SC>she</SC> <SC>he</SC> <SC>she doesn't seem to look</SC> <.></.> <SC>she</SC> it looks <F>mm</F> she doesn't care about her dog.

</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. Can you compare this neighborhood to your neighborhood?</A>
<B>All right. <CO>Compare to this my</CO>. <.></.> <F>Ur</F>. The place I live also <SC>has many</SC> is area where <SC>house</SC> there are many houses. But it's rare to see people walking outside on the street. Also, when I was young, I saw a lot of kids playing outside. But, recently, it's rare I see people even <SC>child</SC> kids playing outside. They must be playing <R>in</R> in their house, or I don't know. <SC>When they are busy</SC> they must be busy in going to cram school, <JP>juku</JP>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Mm</F>. O K. What do you think of <SC>them</SC> present children who don't want to play outside, but, maybe, playing inside doing computer games, or being sent to cram schools? What do you think of them?</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>. I think it's also one of their destiny. Just kids who born this century. But, if I have my <F>ur</F> <SC>children</SC> child, I prefer <F>ur</F> that they just go outside and play with their <R>f</R> <F>ur</F> friends <F>erm</F> rather than going to cram school.</B>
