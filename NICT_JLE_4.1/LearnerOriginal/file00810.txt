<A>Now, I'm going to show you a picture. O K. This one. And would you describe it to me?</A>

And <SC>many students</SC> some of students listening carefully, but some of them <SC>doesn't liste</SC> <F>er</F> don't listen to her. And these two girls are just chatting. And this boy is looking outside. And <nvs>laughter</nvs> <R>he is</R> he is listening his music by himself and <R>drink</R> drinking some drink. And just two, this one girl and one boy are listening to the teacher. But teacher <SC>does seems not</SC> <F>ee</F> doesn't seem to care about all of them.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. Were you a good student?</A>
<B>Yes. <laughter>Definitely</laughter>.</B>
<A>O K. So maybe you remember the atmosphere of your classroom.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Can</OL> you compare the atmosphere?</A>
<B><F>Uum</F>. I think it's very similar to this.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>It was very similar to this. Because <R>my</R> <R>my</R> my <SC>high school</SC> junior high school <SC>was</SC> had <F>er</F> very <F>er</F> free atmosphere.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B>We can do everything we like.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>And <SC>teacher doesn't <F>uum</F> always ca</SC> <SC>teacher does</SC> <F>er</F> teacher <SC>don't kept</SC> <F>er</F> don't keep on <.></.> asking us to do this or just to do it or something like that. We can do <R>every</R> everything <.></.> <SC>I</SC> we like. And <R>I was a</R> I was a very good student.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>So <nvs>laughter</nvs> I always <R>listen to</R> <F>um</F> listen to the class very, very carefully. I never fall asleep during the classroom. But some of my friends just chatting <F>eh</F> <SC>at the class</SC> <F>ee</F> in the classroom. And <R>some of</R> some of them <SC>was fall asleep</SC> <R>f</R> fell asleep. <F>Um</F>.</B>
<A>Really.</A>
<B>I think <R>it's</R> it's very similar. <F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> how could you be such a good student in that atmosphere?</A>
<B><F>Err</F> <F>um</F> <F>um</F>. Because I think one reason is <SC>my parents are</SC> both of my parents are professor of university,</B>
<A><F>Er</F>.</A>
<B>so <R>my</R> <R>my</R> <SC>my ha</SC> <R>my</R> my family was so strict to me. And they always said me that <R>you should</R> you should study very, very hard.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B>Very, very hard. So that is one reason. <R>And</R> <.></.> <R>and</R> <R>and</R> and the other reason is, <SC>I think <F>um</F> my school had such free atmosphere so they didn't</SC> <F>err</F> how can I say, <.></.> I think there is some case that if I was a good student, my friends <R>will</R> will become dislike me or my friends will feel I'm a bit different from them, and <SC>they wanna</SC> they didn't wanna make friends with me. But <F>ee</F> <F>mm</F> <R>in my</R> in my <F>um</F> school, there is no atmosphere like that.</B>
<A><OL>Really</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So I can</OL> made friends with everyone. <F>Um</F>.</B>
<A>Sounds <OL>great</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Um</F></OL>. <F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
