<B><F>Urr</F> <F>urr</F>.

<A>How about English <F>urr</F> progress, or English education progress?</A>
<B><CO>The</CO>.</B>
<A>Do they have any?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Urr</F>. His company <F>err</F> has a <F>mm</F> <SC>idea</SC> <R>ide</R> <SC>idea</SC> <F>urr</F> vision that <F>urr</F> children <SC>who stu</SC> who are studying their materials can <F>urr</F> enter the university <F>ur</F> <F>um</F> and can pass the <R>entrance</R> <F>urr</F> entrance examination of the university <F>ur</F> with no difficulty. <F>Mm</F>.

So <F>urr</F> children are usually <F>urr</F> work <F>um</F> <SC>wo</SC> <F>urr</F> <F>um</F> <SC>pages</SC> <F>urr</F> writing. <F>Um</F> <F>mm</F> <F>uh</F>.

<A>Right, right. But, <F>urr</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, you are interested in this <F>urr</F> conversational English.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>How did you get interested in this conversational English?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>urr</F>. I have <F>mm</F> many reasons. But, <F>urr</F> <F>well</F> let me explain some of the reasons. First, I like <SC>language</SC> languages, <F>urr</F> because <F>urr</F> languages are kind of tool to have good relationship between peoples. So I like Japanese as well as English. And I also learn, <F>urr</F> <SC>sign language</SC> <F>urr</F> I mean, sign language <F>urr</F> for <F>um</F> <R>the</R> the deaf people. <SC>And</SC> <F>mm</F> so <F>urr</F> <SC>I</SC> <SC>that</SC> I like language is the first reason. And <R>second</R> <F>ur</F> second reason is, <F>mmm</F> <SC>I'm</SC> <F>urr</F> when I <.></.> <F>er</F> visited <F>urr</F> <F>ur</F> friend's home in Hawaii, <F>urr</F> I had the difficulty <F>urr</F> speaking English. That was the first motive for me to study English hard. <F>Umm</F>.</B>
