<A>I see. <OL><??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><SC>Because <F>er</F></OL> I got this status</SC> <SC>I do have two</SC> <F>mm</F> at this moment, I have two status. One is <SC>the <F>er</F> being here</SC> being as an exchange researcher between <H pn="school name1">XXX03</H> and then in my home university which is <F><?>well</?></F> I <SC>gived you</SC> <SC>give you</SC> given you in my <F>mm</F> <JP>meishi</JP></B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><OL>card</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL> I'm not exactly sure what exactly <SC>a <F>ur</F> research</SC> an exchange researcher does. Can you explain a little bit more about that?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I hope I could. <F>Um</F> see I wanted to come over <R>to</R> to Japan for longer period of time. I've been, as I told you before, <SC?>to</SC?> over twenty years in Germany. <?>Now I have this</?> <F>mm</F> position at the university, <H pn="school name4">XXX09</H> in <H pn="others4">XXX10</H>. And I want to help in a research <F>ur</F> over <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the Japanese <SC>education</SC> <?>language</?> education and <F>er</F> I applied for this <F>ur</F> taking a leave, <F>ur</F> <F>uh</F> <F>mm</F> <F>uh</F> but my position does not have or <SC?>is</SC?> <F>mm</F> cannot be given this sort of sabbatical. So <F>er</F> I do have to <R?>have the</R?> <F>um</F> <?>have the</?> some apply for the <F>er</F> vacation, one-year leave,</B>

<A><F>Hm</F>. <OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><SC>on</OL> which I've <F>er</F> did</SC> <F>ah</F> no, <F>mm</F> for which I was quite successful. Because <SC>I have</SC> <R>on</R> on the one hand, I have <SC>the</SC> <F>um</F> applied for the <F>er</F> so-called fellowship</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>in <F>er</F> Japanese education and <SC>which I</SC> fortunately I could receive one from the <F>er</F> <H pn="others5">XXX11</H>.</B>
<A>Good. Good.</A>
<B>And <F>oh</F> <SC>this</SC> at the same time, I applied for this exchange researcher program between <F>um</F> <H pn="school name1">XXX03</H> and my home <OL>university</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F> it's</OL> great.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> again, concerning <R>the</R> the same theme.</B>
<A>Right. <OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Because with</OL> they do have here, this <F>mm</F> Japanese Department, <OL>right</OL>?</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <?>this</?> <SC>Japanese</SC> Department of Japanese Education.</B>
<A>O K. That's great. <OL>So <R>you're</R></OL></A>
<B><OL><CO>So <??></??></OL> <OL>I've got the two</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>you're here</R></OL></A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A>you're here for a year.</A>
<B>Right.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> after such a long time,</A>
<B><laughter><F>Um</F> not quite</laughter>. <OL><laughter><CO><?>It's a such</?></CO></laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>not being</R> not being in Japan</OL>,</A>
<B><OL>Right</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>er</F></OL> <OL><R>what</R> <R>what</R></OL></A>
<B><OL>Yes, <??></??></OL>.</B>
<A>what thing has changed the most since <?>you don't remember</?>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Ah</F> <SC>it's <?>really</?> twenty</SC></OL></B>
<A><OL><CO><F>Oh</F> <F>oh</F> twenty year ago and now, <R>you look a</R></OL> <OL>you look at</CO></OL>.</A>
<B>actually <R>i</R> <R>i</R> it's been over almost thirty <OL>years</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Well</F> almost thirty years then</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><??></??></OL> because I <??></??>.</B>
<A>What's changed most?</A>
<B>What changed most? I would <SC>say the</SC> <F>er</F> say, first of all, the appearances of the <F>er</F> younger people and also behavior pattern. <F>Um</F> can you relate to it? <CO>When I say before the</CO>. <OL>Perhaps, right, yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Perhaps</OL>. <OL><CO>Could you <SC?>ex</SC?> tell me a little more about what you</CO></OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Maybe I should be</OL> more specific. Like <F>erm</F> when left Japan for <?>which as</?> I said <F>er</F> thirty years ago, that was <R>se</R> <SC>seventy</SC> actually seventy-three, so <F>er</F> exactly thirty years ago, right? I went to the States in order to, say, brush up my <R>E</R> English. <F>Mm</F> I wanted to learn. I was a <SC>Ja</SC> English teacher at <F>mm</F> the junior high school. And <F>er</F> <SC>I wanted</SC> I was not satisfied with my proficiency, so <F>er</F> I went to brush up. And I went <R>to th</R> to the States. And <F>er</F> there, I spent <SC>three</SC> four years and then <SC>happened to</SC> it happened that <SC>I</SC> you know, I've been to Germany and I got to know my husband before then, I mean. <F>Um</F> and I went to Germany and it's been over <SC>twenty</SC> <?>say</?> <SC>twenty-s</SC> <SC>twenty-four</SC> twenty-six years. <SC>The</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>the most</SC> <F>ur</F> the biggest different I would say is like <F>er</F> the younger people <SC?>who wouldn't</SC?> <F>um</F> <F>er</F> who can be very <F>mm</F> creative, not all of them, some of them are still sort of uniformed way of thinking and <?><F>well</F></?> appearances. But still the <F>er</F> differences <SC>in terms of the</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> say, <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> <F>well</F> how should I describe it, in terms of the <F>er</F> not only appearance but the way they behave. Like <F>er</F> having, you know, <F>mm</F> brown hair or <JP>kinpatsu</JP> <F>mm</F> <SC>as I say</SC> as I've been calling "golden hair" <F>er</F> <SC>the color</SC> the younger people <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> <SC>he</SC> color their hairs <F>em</F> which are allowed <R>as</R> <F>er</F> as such.</B>
<A><nvs>cough</nvs></A>
<B>They wouldn't be <SC>san</SC> socially sanctioned, right? And <SC>when I</SC> so this sort of freedom on the one hand in terms of the what they wear, and in terms of the <F>er</F> behavioral pattern, I would say, <F>er</F> people are quite permissive now. Maybe the older generation cannot do anything against it. <CO>It could be <?>as</?> bad, but still</CO>.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><F>Em</F>. <OL><??></??> Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>I can relate to</R> I can relate to that</OL>.</A>
<B>And sort of this traditional way of Japanese patterns which <SC>would be called</SC> can be called as <JP>nihon-jin rashii</JP> <F>er</F> you know, quite typical <?>prototype of</?> Japanese <??></??> <F>er</F> to see in that extent. So I would say this is <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> for me the <SC>most</SC> <F>um</F> yeah, biggest <SC?>problem</SC?> <R>d</R> difference.</B>
<A>Yeah. Sure.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>I can</R></OL> I can rather imagine that.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. First of all, <R>in</R> in the interview, we have to <F>er</F> show you a picture. I'd like you to describe this picture in detail</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>for me.</A>
<B>So <F>er</F> <SC>in terms of</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>there's a</SC> <F>uh</F> <R>y</R> you mean <R>the</R> the whole picture <R>or</R> or <OL>what I see</OL>?</B>
<A><OL>Just <F>uh</F></OL> <R>wh</R> what you see.</A>
<B><SC>It's just like</SC> <F>er</F> this is <R>the</R> <F>er</F> <F>erm</F> the drawing concerns <SC>the</SC> probably a <SC>one-room</SC> apartment room for the <SC>lady</SC> young lady <F>er</F> sitting in front of her computer. And <F>er</F> there's one big <F>er</F> window. And she has <F>er</F> probably two pets belong to her, <F>er</F> I guess. One is sleeping <F>hm</F> right next to the bed. And on the bed, <F>er</F> she has a <?>red tiger</?>. <SC>It's <F>um</F> German</SC> in Germany, <SC>I had a</SC> I used to have <SC>the</SC> <SC>some kind of</SC> this <OL>type of</OL> the cat</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>with a long, you know, tail. And she's looking at this two pets and just <F>er</F> quite happy. And actually her <SC>sh</SC> computer is now been <F>hm</F> put on. She has two types of <?>so</?> writing system. <F>Mm</F> interesting. One is the <F>er</F> <F>er</F> typewriter <SC?>in the</SC?> next to <SC>the</SC> her computer. And I can also see at <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the other side of the wall, she has this hi-fi system and underneath some box and calendar on top of it.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And the door is open and I imagine that would be about the size of my room <SC?>where</SC?> which I have now <R>in</R> in <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>.</B>

<A>yeah, if you don't mind.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F> <OL>I don't</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL> I'd like you to look at this sequence of pictures here. Going from one to six. One, two, three, four, five, six. And I'd like you to make up a story</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>based on these pictures. But this story happened before, so please start the story or the sequence, "One day last week," and then from number one.</A>
<B>One day last week, a <F>mm</F> <SC>man</SC> businessman called, say, he <F>er</F> must be then Japanese man, <SC>Takagi</SC> Mister Takagi went to the <F>er</F> station. And <SC>he want to take</SC> <F>er</F> he has to take his train. It is <F>uh</F> <SC>eight o'clock</SC> eight-five. And it happened that he had <F>er</F> or just because <SC?>his</SC?> <F>mm</F> <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> man standing right next to him <SC>sho</SC> <F>mm</F> <R>g</R> <F>mm</F> <R>gave</R> <F>uh</F> <SC?>gave them</SC?> <SC>gave him <F>um</F> the</SC> <F>er</F> was his elbow <F>ur</F> pushed him so that his bag, which was quite important, <F>er</F> fell off <F>mm</F> right on the <F>er</F> rails in between. And it was behind it and he <SC>wanted to hi</SC> <F>ur</F> wanted him to take it, but <R?>wh</R?> <SC?>wh</SC?> <R?>d</R?> <SC?>di</SC?> <SC?>the ner</SC?> the man next to him was quite mean, and he wouldn't take it, right? And then in the meantime, people were around <??></??> <F>mm</F> just watching them and it was quite embarrassing. But nonetheless he wouldn't do it. Now, it happened <R>that</R> that the train came right <?>in it</?>. <F>Er</F> <SC?>it</SC?> this moment, and the <SC>Takagi</SC> Mister Takagi thought, you know, <SC>his <.></.> bag which <??></??> say his <SC>case</SC> <F>huh</F> briefcase</SC>, <?>how do you say, his</?> brief case? His case were beaten and just torn off. But <.></.> he was so relieved <F>well</F> so am I, <F>er</F> because <SC>I</SC> he had in his <F>erm</F> briefcase the whole reports of <R>the</R> <F>er</F> you know, <SC>bu</SC> important business negotiation and he was so relieved. And the <R>man</R> <F>well</F> man next to him was also nice enough <SC>to have this</SC> <F>mm</F> to share this <OL>relief</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
