<A><F>Mm</F></A>
<B><F>Mhm</F> First of all, it's quite different from the Tokyo, city areas. <R>A lot</R> a lot of natures like sea, mountain, so quite different. People also.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> How are the people different from the people in Tokyo?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> It's obviously <F>um</F> people in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>, <F>ur</F> <SC>they are general</SC> generally they are very <F>um</F> warm hearted. <SC>Not really like</SC> because probably my guess is that <F>ur</F> Tokyo is kind of too many peoples living here, so and then you know, <??></??>. So it's just crowded whatever we do. But <F>um</F> in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>, there isn't much people <laughter>obviously</laughter>. <SC>And then</SC> <R>so</R> so then you know, <SC>people are just</SC> I mean people are not, you know, get tired of seeing the people. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>

So I've been here from the <F>ur</F> <R>master</R> master program. So that this is second year. So just two years. And so my tennis career is like less than two years of course. And <F>urm</F> my father <R>plays</R> plays tennis, too. And <R>he</R> <SC>he</SC> I mean he was a very good player when he was a high school student. But like <R>these</R> these days he doesn't really play with anyone since he just got really tired, and stay home. <SC>Then</SC> <SC>and then now I just</SC> then I started to play with him. So that he is <SC>very</SC> you know, very excited, glad to play with me. So every time when I come back to my home, he wanted to play with me as like, "<H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>, why don't we go?". <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
