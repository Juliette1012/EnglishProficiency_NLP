<A><H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. What is your name?</A>
<B>My name is <F>ee</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>

<B><F>Ah</F>. Fine, thank you. How about you?</B>
<A><F>Uh</F>. I'm fine too, thank you very much. O K. <F>Um</F>. What do you do?</A>
<B><.></.> For job?</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. Now, I belongs to the formulations production scheduling sections.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F> <F>um</F>. <.></.> What do you do every day?</A>
<B><F>Uh</F>. So I am in charge of <F>uh</F> section manager, so I <R>co</R> collaborate with my colleagues <F>uh</F> one guys and two ladies. And, everyday, <F>uh</F> they managed about <?>toll</?> manufacturing. Do you understand <??></??> <?>toll</?>?</B>
<A>No.</A>
<B>We have the facility to produce our product, <?>pesticide</?> product, but the <F>uh</F> our production site is not able to cover all production.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B>We have the variety of the <?>pesticide</?> product, one of the solid, other is a liquid. But <F>uh</F> <.></.> some of the product are not able to produce <F>um</F> in-house, so, <F>er</F> every day, now colleagues managed to the other <?>pesticide</?> company to ask to produce our product.</B>
<A>O K, O K. So, do you like you job?</A>
<B>Yeah, but, <F>er</F> former time, I belong to the factory site, so <SC>we</SC> it is a, <F>eh</F> <.></.> what can I say, <F>er</F> <?>even now</?>, to concentrate our production at factory. But, now, we think about <F>uh</F> our own factory production schedule and also other <?>toll</?> formulation <?>schedule</?>. So it is rather complicated <R>and the</R> <R>and the</R> and, the former time, <SC>we <SC>can't</SC> don't</SC> I don't have the contact with other department, for example, the sales department. But, now, we sitting on the head office, so we surrounded sales department people. So, <.></.> often, they came to, and "Would you please to change the amount of production for this month or next month?". So, every day, changing the production schedule. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Lots of trouble for you</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><laughter>Yeah</laughter></OL></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. Besides work, <F>um</F> do you have any hobby?</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Um</F>. I like <F>um</F> music. <F>Er</F>. <SC>Former</SC> in our university days, we belong to the <F>er</F> folk song club.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I played</OL> guitar, <F>er</F> but, after graduated, <F>er</F> there are no chance to play the guitar because <F>er</F> we need <F>uh</F> groups.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>I played guitar, so we need <F>uh</F> bass or drums or vocals or keyboard. <CO>But <F>er</F> it's a difficult to</CO>. And, of course, I played guitar at <F>uh</F> rural place. <F>Uh</F>. My hometown is Yamaguchi, so <??></??> skill level of <SC>a player</SC> <SC>amateur level</SC> amateur play is not so high compared with a Tokyo.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Really?</A>
<B>Or big cities. So <F>uh</F> <SC>it's a very</SC> <.></.> I hated to play with <OL>other amateur players</OL> in this areas.</B>
<A><OL><laughter><F>Uh</F> O K</laughter></OL>. <R>Wh</R> <R>wh</R> why do you think so? Why do you think Yamaguchi player is little bit level off?</A>
<B>Yeah. It's a depend on the population, I think.</B>
<A><CO>Because Tokyo has</CO>.</A>
<B>Many many young guys plays the guitar and piano, so, <SC>some of the</SC> maybe, ratio is not so <R>dif</R> different from the <F>um</F> rural area and big cities. But, <F>er</F> how can I say, volume of <R>po</R> population is completely different. So <SC>top skill player</SC> the <SC>ma</SC> number of top <R>skill</R> skill <SC>players</SC> amateur players is a bigger than <?>other</?> small towns.</B>
<A>Yeah, maybe, yeah, maybe.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K, first thing today, O K. <F>Um</F>. Please describe this picture for me.</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Um</F>. This shows a class, maybe, junior high school or high school. Now, <R>the</R> <R>the</R> the lady teacher <F>um</F> teaching about mathematics and <SC>draw</SC> draw down <F>eh</F> graphs. <.></.> <SC>And</SC> but <F>uh</F> some of students are not concentrate to <SC>the</SC> this <SC>class</SC> studies. Some of this, <F>oh</F> <.></.> he is <R>same</R> same hobby <OL><?>as me</?></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter>Yeah</laughter>.</A>
<B>Listening <F>er</F> the music some and the <?>sn</?>, yeah. <..></..> Yeah.</B>
<A>That's all?</A>
<B>Yeah, and <F>uh</F> <F>um</F> there's a little bit different from the Japanese <F>er</F> school, because I think <F>er</F> some ladies wears tank tops but others <F>er</F> <F>er</F> traditional Japanese sailer <.></.> clothes. <.></.> <F>Uh</F>. And, in Japan, maybe, beside of the <F>um</F> private school, <SC?>public school did</SC?> <F>er</F> school force to student to wear the uniform clothes, so is a lot different from those <F>um</F> public Japanese schools. <.></.> And also, <.></.> maybe, <SC>it's</SC> <F>um</F> yeah, first I saw this and she calculated with electric calculator, but <F>uh</F> not calculator, it's a handy phone. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><laughter>Yeah, yeah</laughter>. O K, thank you very much.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. You mentioned about the uniform. What do you think about it?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. Yeah. <.></.> So, when I was a junior high school or high school students, at that time, uniform is a better for <.></.> me because <SC>don't</SC> it's not necessary to care about today which clothes I want to put on or something. But, <F>um</F> nowadays, <F>er</F> <F>er</F> how can I say, philosophy of <?>all</?> the personality is gradually changing. So I am rather older <F>er</F> generation, so <SC>I don't think</SC> I didn't think about <F>uh</F> <R>difference</R> <SC>difference</SC> different <SC>popularities more</SC> <F>um</F> personalities more, how can I say, <.></.> <F>um</F> <..></..> people think about more seriously about personality, but, <F>er</F> former time, <SC>not so think about</SC> <SC>don't</SC> didn't think about. So, now, all of the people think <F>er</F> personalities are main point. <CO>So I think it's not</CO>. <F>Uh</F> <F>uh</F>. Recent trend to changing <?>the</?> <R>ru</R> rule of a school to wear <SC>which kind of</SC> which kind clothes, what do you want is a good situation, I think.</B>
<A>Maybe, fit to <R>the</R> the time era now. O K, thank you very much.</A>
</followup>

<A>O K. May I help you, Sir?</A>
<B>Yeah, I bought this goods <F>um</F> today, but, <F>um</F> after I went back to my home, I opened the package. So, yeah, maybe, <F>um</F> how can I say, when I saw this <R>go</R> goods at the this department, is a very nice for me. But, <F>uh</F> in a home, I opened the packages, the, how can I say, colors something different <SC>my</SC> from my image. Maybe, it cause by the, how can I say, decoration light or, department stores <F>uh</F> <F>ee</F> <F>er</F> installed the special lights so make the color more vivid or something. So, <F>uh</F> would you please change <SC>other clothes</SC> other colors, yeah?</B>
<A>You checked at the store, right?</A>
<B>Yeah, but, <F>um</F> <SC>the time</SC> yeah, <SC>I thought</SC> <F>um</F> I think it was better for me to check also this <F>er</F> down light for this clothes lamp, and also, this brought to <R>the</R> the window side to check <SC>the</SC> under the sunlight, but <F>uh</F> <SC>there</SC> it was my fault. But <F>uh</F> I hesitate <SC>to do</SC> to that. This situation is not polite to go this departments.</B>
<A>O K. I do understand, but my manager is away now for lunch. And I can't decide.</A>
<B>O K. So <.></.> I'll look around other corners, so, would you please negotiate your manager? So I go back <F>uh</F> <R>two</R> two hours later. <CO>So</CO>.</B>

So, before I went to overseas, I thought <.></.> is O K to clean or wash myself or something, but <F>um</F> is a very, how can I say, hard to me because <F>uh</F> very delinquent personality. So, finally, I <SC>s</SC> <SC>asked my</SC> <SC>ask</SC> asked the hotel managers, and <F>uh</F> <??></??> <SC>they informed me</SC> they <?>taught</?> me to the department stores.
