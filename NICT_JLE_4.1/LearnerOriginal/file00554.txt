<A><F>Uum</F>. When you are leaving?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. Sixteenth of next month.</B>
<A><.></.> <F>Wow</F>. Less than a month.</A>
<B>Yeah. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>How do you feel?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I have friends there. So it's not too scary or anything.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>. Do you have to use your English ability when you start working?</A>
<B><R>I thi</R> <F>uh</F> I think so. <F>Well</F> I can speak Spanish, so I <?>don't</?> think I'll be using English.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. I see. Good. All right. Now, <.></.> <R>what</R> what's your hobby?</A>
<B><F>Uum</F>. I like traveling. I've been to <F>er</F> many countries like Russia, <F>erm</F> Canada, and New Zealand, Taiwan, and <F>er</F> China, Hong Kong, <??></??> <OL><??></??> like that</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Wow</F></OL>. I see. How did you like Russia?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. I didn't go there to travel. I was <F>erm</F> member of <F>um</F> Russia's advanced student conference.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B>So I went there to <F>um</F> participate in the conference. <F>Um</F>. I thought it is very different from Japan, because there is no advertisement at all.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>Like</SC> <?>let's see</?>. And <F>um</F> <SC>people there</SC> <F>uum</F> <SC>like</SC> Russian people are really different from like foreigners that I used to know. Like Americans <?>and stuff</?>.</B>
<A>What do you mean?</A>
<B><laughter><F>Uum</F></laughter>. I don't know. Like <R>they</R> they think stuff in a different <?>ways for</?> some reason. Like they think stuff really like <?>motley</?>. They are pessimistic for some reason.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> But, I mean, my impression is that they really like studying. They are hard working people. And <F>um</F> they also had really good command of English, too. Some of them study like three languages or something.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>I see. What else? When you are not traveling, what do you do?</A>
<B><laughter><F>Uum</F></laughter>. I don't know what. I <F>um</F> watch movies, <F>um</F> like mainly Hollywood movies. <F>Um</F>. For example, <R>I</R> I went to see like "A I" twice, <laughter>already</laughter>.</B>
<A><laughter>Twice</laughter>?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> Beause <F>er</F> I really like it.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>um</F> I don't know, but like watching movies in Japan is really expensive. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>I know.</A>
<B>I go there on like Wednesday like <F>er</F> lady's day.</B>
<A><OL><F>Um</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Like</OL> you can sit <?>there</?> to see it like <F>er</F> <??></??> or something, yeah. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. Yeah. I go to movies like <F>er</F> twice a month or something.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>. I see. Good. All right. Now, let's see. <.></.> <F>Oh</F> <F>oh</F> <F>er</F> are you living <SC>yourself</SC> by <OL>yourself now</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A>O K. Where do you live?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. I live in <H pn="others2">XXX05</H>.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. Twenty minutes by <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> Line from <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>.</B>
<A>I see. So, when you go to <H pn="others1">XXX04</H>, what are you going to do with your apartment?</A>
<B>I'm moving out. I mean, I'm sending off my stuff to my parents. I mean, my family's place which is <?>place</?> in <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>

<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>I don't think I keep the apartment.</B>
<A>Wh do you already know you are going to work at <H pn="others6">XXX09</H>?</A>
<B>Because the human resource people told me that <F>um</F> <R>you</R> you're working in <F>um</F> International Sales Division. You probably <F>er</F> work in Kansai area like <H pn="others6">XXX09</H> or <H pn="others7">XXX10</H>.</B>

<B>I think so.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> O K. Let's change that. Then, here. Please describe this picture for me.</A>
<B><F>Uum</F>. Many people are skiing. And this looks like <F>um</F> mountain, and it's winter. And <F>um</F> there is a coffee shop or something in <.></.> this lodging. And <F>um</F> <F>uum</F> the sky is clear. And <F>um</F> people wearing like really colorful ski wears. And, <F>err</F> I don't know, there is a snowman in a ground. And <F>um</F> <F>um</F> four kids are playing with the snows. And one guy is like falling down on a ski. <F>Erm</F> <F>uum</F> <F>umm</F>. And looks like <F>um</F> <F>um</F> the ski lesson is taking place, yeah. <F>Um</F>. This guy is teaching to <F>er</F> three people how to ski, yeah.</B>
<A>All right.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Now, he is <F>er</F> snowboarding.</A>
<B><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><SC><OL>Why do</OL> yo</SC> recently, lots of people enjoy snowboarding. Why do you think snowboarding is so popular amongst young generation?</A>
<B><.></.> <R>I don't</R> I don't know. It's one of those trend stuff. And, <F>er</F> I guess, <F>er</F> like if you wanna playing in the snow, like I think <F>um</F> <.></.> you had only one choice which is skiing. But like because of <F>er</F> snowboarding, like you can do different stuff from other people. So, that's why I think the young Japanese people think it's cool.</B>
<A>What do you mean, different stuff?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. You know, different from majority of people skiing.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>So, <F>um</F> you know, young people likes to do different stuff <laughter>from</laughter> like majorities. So I think that that's the reason.</B>

<stage3>
<task>
<A>Next, I would like to do a role play.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is taking out a card.</ctxt>
<A>O K. Have you seen this one before?</A>

<B><F>Uum</F>. <R>I</R> I bought a clothes. But it didn't fit me.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B>It was too small.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <.></.> basically, <F>er</F> exchanging or refund is <F>er</F> against our policy. We normally don't do that.</A>
<B>Yes. But <SC>I didn't like</SC> <F>um</F> <.></.> I didn't throw away my receipt or anything. And I have receipt here, and I have product. <F>Er</F>. Like <.></.> product tax <.></.> <?>receipt</?> <.></.> like stuff. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>

<A><F>Well</F> <F>er</F> giving <SC>your</SC> to your family is not our concern. <SC>It's just that</SC> <F>er</F> exchanging the product is not <F>er</F> acceptable. Besides, <SC>why you didn't check it</SC> why didn't you check it in a fitting room before you buy it?</A>
<B>Because I was in a hurry. And <F>um</F> <R>I</R> I check the size tag, and it says like medium. So I <?>thought</?> <F>er</F> <?>it</?> <R?>fit me</R?> fit me, but it didn't. So <SC>I don't</SC> <SC>it's not my</SC> I don't think <laughter>it's my</laughter> fault.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. But <R>you</R> you bought it.</A>
<B>Yeah. But the size tag said it's medium. <CO>And</CO>.</B>
<A>Yeah. This size is actually medium.</A>
<B><R>I</R> <SC>I didn't</SC> I mean, I'm small. So like <R>I</R> I normally buy like one or two, size. So I thought the medium would be a little bigger or something. But it didn't fit me. <CO>So</CO>.</B>

<A>All right.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Now, there are lots of people who use cellular phone on <R>the</R> the car or on the train. What do you think about them?</A>
<B><F>Uum</F>. <.></.> I don't like them. I mean, <R>it's</R> it's really annoying. And <F>um</F> like driving a car <F>um</F> <F>er</F> talking on a cell phone at the same time is really dangerous. And harm people <F>erm</F> walking <?>and</?> stuff. And <F>er</F> talking on the cell phone in the train is, I mean, you can answer the phone and like say something like "I will call you back.". <CO>Or</CO>.</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>Briefly. But <SC>it's</SC> that's fine. But like people <R>who</R> who, you know, talks and talks and talks for like twenty minutes or something in a train, that's really like trouble for other passengers, I think.</B>
