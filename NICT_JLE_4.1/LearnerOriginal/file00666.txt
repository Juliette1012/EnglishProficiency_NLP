<B>About the campus. <F>Urm</F>. At our university, we have two campuses, one in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, and one in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. And since I belong to the Technology Department, <F>ur</F> I'm on the <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> campus <F>ur</F> which is very unlike the <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> campus. <SC>And the</SC> <F>ur</F> at <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> campus, we have lots of trees because there is the agriculture <R>of</R> of department there. <F>Ur</F> However, <F>ur</F> the technology <F>ur</F> <R>cam</R> <F>ur</F> campus is just buildings. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

<B>I like <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> better. <OL><F>Mm</F></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Uhh</F></OL> I see.</A>
<B>It's more relaxing. And <F>um</F> you get to enjoy nature <F>urm</F> in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> <F>ur</F> which is <F>ur</F> rare thing now a days.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F> I see. O K. So <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>, where do you live?</A>
<B>I live in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> <JP>shi</JP>.</B>
<A><.></.> So is it your home town?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A>What's good about living there?</A>
<B>First of all, it's close to the university. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And <F>ur</F> there's a lots of nature there, too.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>. Yes. <F>Ur</F> We have lots of farmers still <F>ur</F> who are growing vegetables. And so we get fresh vegetables every day. <F>Mm</F>. So you get to feel the season <F>urm</F> through <F>ur</F> the vegetables.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. But <F>ur</F> did you see any changes over the years in your place?</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F>. Fortunately, not too much change. <F>Urm</F>. But <F>um</F> yes, we have lots of houses and apartments and <F>urm</F> lots of buildings have been built in the past several years. But fortunately, we still have lots of nature there. <F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Good. O K. Do you have any hobbies?</A>
<B>Hobbies. I used to <F>urm</F> play the piano. <F>Mm</F> <F>urm</F>. But now a days I'm too busy to really <F>urm</F> enjoy any hobbies. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><F>Um</F>. But I like cooking also. <F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. So why are you so buy recently?</A>
<B>Recently, <F>urm</F> <F>well</F> there's lots of things going on at the university. We have lots of changes and lots of curriculum, <F>urm</F> improvements that have to be made. And also <F>ur</F> the Ministry of Education is pressuring us to go into the new systems. And so there's lots of committee meetings. <F>Urm</F>. So everyday <F>ur</F> it's like you have meetings, and in between meetings, you're teaching. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter>O K</laughter>. All right.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>So let's see. First thing today, please look at this picture.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>And please describe this picture.</A>
<B>Describe it. O K. <F>Urm</F>. This is a ski resort. And there are many people enjoying skiing. <F>Urm</F>. There are some that are really <F>urm</F> professionals, and just skiing <F>ur</F> right down through. However there are some that are tumbling and falling down. <F>Urm</F>. On the other hand, there aren't just skiers there. There are a lots of children there. And <F>ur</F> they have snow ball fights. <F>Urm</F>. And <F>urm</F> <R>in the club house</R> I guess it is, in the club house, you see some people, instead of just skiing, they are inside and relaxing and having a cup of coffee. And <F>um</F> <F>mm</F> <..></..> I guess that's it. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>. All right. Thank you very much.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>, can you ski?</A>
<B>No.</B>
<A>Never?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. When I was little, <SC>I used to</SC> <F>ur</F> my parents took me to skiing. But unfortunately, I don't like the concept of going up when you know <R>that you</R> that you have to come down. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So rather than skiing, I prefer skating because skating, you don't have to go up, and you're just going round and round on this flat surface. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> O K. Interesting.</A>
<B>But of course I know <F>urm</F> is for some people, <F>ur</F> it sounds strange because people who enjoy skiing <F>ur</F> tell me that you can enjoy lots of things when you go up because you see a different view <F>urm</F> up there. You see lots of beautiful mountains, and the scenery is completely different from when you're on the ground. <F>Urm</F>. <SC>But</SC> however now, I can never <F>urm</F> understand the concept of going up when you know that you have to come down. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>All right. O K. This is a <SC>ski field</SC> ski slope. And like golf field and ski field, they have to cut trees to make <SC>those</SC> this kind of recreational equipment or <F>ur</F> institute. <SC>What do you think of that</SC> what do you think of wasting trees and mountains and making up the institute which will create money?</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F> O K. <F>Urm</F> I think there are two things that you have to <F>ur</F> think about. First of all, in the long term, <F>urm</F> it's not good to <F>ur</F> cut down trees <F>ur</F> because of the nature and environment. You have to protect the environment. And the trees <F>ur</F> help us in many ways because they provide the oxygen for the human beings. And it's not just a scenery. <F>Ur</F> <F>mm</F>. It's not just the trees are there <SC>to be</SC> <F>ur</F> to provide beautiful scenery. <SC>They're also there to</SC> <F>urm</F> actually they're really contributing to our <F>urm</F> life as human beings. <F>Ur</F>. So in the long run, I think you have to <F>urm</F> control the number of the trees that you can cut down. However, <F>urm</F> especially now a days, when you think of the depression <F>urm</F> that we're facing in this country, <F>ur</F> you need to provide ways so that people can use money. And in that sense, if there're lots of people who enjoy skiing, and <F>urm</F> they would prefer probably to go to new areas and new <SC>resort</SC> <F>ur</F> places. So in that case, <F>urm</F> if you look at it from the economical point, <F>um</F> I think it's important <F>ur</F> to develop at least in some aspects <F>urm</F> these new areas. So that people will have <F>ur</F> opportunities to use money. Because if you don't use money, then <R>we can</R> <R>we can</R> we can never get out of this depression.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F></B>
<A>O K. All right. Thank you very much.</A>
</followup>
</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A>Next, <F>ur</F> let's try a role play. O K. Please read this card, and when you're ready, I will begin.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card for a while.</ctxt>
<B><F>Mm</F> O K.</B>
<A>O K?</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A>Good morning, ma'am. May I help you?</A>
<B>Yes. Good morning. <F>Urm</F> I have a problem here. <F>Urm</F>. This is my ticket, and I was supposed to get on that train that just left. <F>Urm</F> I was wondering if it would be possible for you to <F>urm</F> give me back my money, or give me a new ticket so that I can get on the next train?</B>
<A><F>Ohh</F> I'm sorry, ma'am, but that's against our policy.</A>
<B>I know it is. And I know <F>urm</F> it's really not <F>urm</F> what I'm supposed to be asking you. But I have to attend this very important meeting. And I have to get on the next train. If I can't, <F>urm</F> I'll have to find <F>ur</F> other <F>ur</F> ways of getting there. And probably the best way to get there is by taxi. Unfortunately, I don't have enough money with me right now. So I was wondering if you could just give me back the money, <CO>or</CO>. <F>er</F>.</B>
<A>Why don't you buy another one. It's cheaper than taking a taxi.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> that's true. But the problem is if I do that, I can't get back.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Oh</F>. Why were you late in the first place?</A>
<B>Yeah, I know. I'm really sorry. <F>Um</F>. It's really my fault really. <F>Um</F>. It's really my fault, and <F>um</F> I have nothing to say about that. I mean it's really my fault. <F>Urm</F>. But <F>um</F> could you just bend the rules a little bit this time once? <F>Urm</F>. Because it's really important that I get on the next train that <SC>just <?>really</?></SC> just <SC>re</SC> right there in the platform.</B>
<A><laughter>O K</laughter>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. And if I miss that train, <SC>really</SC> <F>urm</F> <R>I'm</R> I'm really in big trouble.</B>
<A>O K. I'll talk to my manager.</A>
<B>O K. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. I really appreciate it. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><laughter>O K</laughter>, all right, thank you very much</OL>. This is the end of the role play.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. So have you ever had a similar experience, like missing a train or plane or?</A>
<B>No.</B>
<A>Never?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>. Time is very important for me. <F>Ur</F>. That's one of the basic policies I think for me. That's <F>urr</F> very important for me. So that's what I teach my students, too, <F>ur</F> to be punctual. <SC>I</SC> something that I regard it's very important in your life.</B>
<A>Have you ever taken a train in a foreign country?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Can you compare that train to the trains in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>?</A>
<B>First of all, in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>, you have lots of these announcements on the train. They tell you all the time "Please don't forget your belongings", <F>ur</F> "Please <F>ur</F> make sure that you don't forget your umbrellas" and so on. <SC>Where as</SC> <F>um</F> in foreign countries, you don't have all these announcements. And <SC>That's some</SC> <F>ur</F> sometimes it's very difficult when you're travelling in a country where you don't know the language. Because you don't know even the name of the station. <F>Urm</F>. So you have to <SC>ca</SC> keep counting the number of the stations that you're passing by. <F>Um</F>. Otherwise there's no announcements there. But once you get used to it, <F>urm</F> you start thinking about <F>um</F> what is service. Maybe <F>urm</F> for the Japanese, we feel that getting lots of these <SC>ama</SC> announcements is something that is needed to provide good service. <F>Urm</F>. However, I think that <F>um</F> maybe that isn't <F>ur</F> really the case. <F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see.</A>
</followup>
</stage3>
<stage4>
<task>
<A>O K. All right. Lastly, there's a sequence of pictures. O K. <F>Well</F> there're six pictures from one to six. And please make up a story based on these pictures. And this happened before. So please start your story with "One day last week".</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures.</ctxt>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A>O K?</A>
<B>O K. <F>Urm</F>. One day last week, <F>ur</F> young man was driving his car. <F>Urm</F>. And <F>um</F> he was rather in a rush <F>urr</F> because he had to get there on time. And then <F>urm</F> another man, <F>urr</F> he was riding on a motorcycle, <F>urm</F> and he was talking with his girl friend on the cell phone. <F>Urm</F>. And he was enjoying the conversation so much that he didn't <F>urm</F> notice the car <F>ur</F> that was turning left. And <F>urm</F> unfortunately, <F>urm</F> <SC>the man bumped into</SC> <F>ur</F> the man on the motorcycle bumped in to the car. And he dropped his cell phone. <F>Urm</F>. Both of the men stopped. And the man on the motorcycle complained to the man in the car that <SC>his cell phone had</SC> <F>urr</F> his cell phone was broken, and also that <F>ur</F> the motorcycle was damaged, <F>urm</F> and that he should <F>ur</F> do something about it. And he was complaining <R>to the <F>ur</F> young</R> <F>ur</F> to the young man that was driving the car. So they decided that <F>ur</F> they should call the police. <F>Ur</F>. Once the police officer <F>urm</F> came to the site, <F>ur</F> the man driving the car explained to the police man that <F>ur</F> <SC>he was not responsible <F>ur</F> for the accident, <F>ur</F> rather than</SC> <F>urr</F> no, I'm sorry, <F>urm</F> <F>ur</F> he was not <F>urm</F> responsible for the accident, and that rather it was the man on the motorcycle who should <F>ur</F> take the blame because it was his fault that he was <F>ur</F> driving and <F>ur</F> talking on the phone which was of course against the law. And so <F>urm</F> he explained to the police man that he was not responsible, and that <F>ur</F> the man on the motorcycle should not be allowed to <F>ur</F> ride the motorcycle, and be penalized. <F>Urm</F>. The police man understood <F>ur</F> the situation. And so <F>urm</F> he made arrangements so that <F>ur</F> <R>the</R> the man driving the motorcycle <F>ur</F> would not be able to drive it for a while because it was against the law. And so they had to take away the motorcycle to make sure that he wouldn't be able to drive again.</B>
