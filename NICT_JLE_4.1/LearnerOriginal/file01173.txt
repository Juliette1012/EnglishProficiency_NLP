<A>O K. When you're not working, what do you like to do, <??></??>?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> sorry?</B>
<A>When you're not working, what do you like to do?</A>
<B><F>Uuum</F> actually, <F>uum</F> before I went to the United States, I didn't have any time to do something except for job, but now I have time, so I want to go some musicals or some performance <?>to see</?> because <F>um</F> <SC>I have</SC> I had never been to such kind of shows and musicals or plays before I went to the United States. But while I was in New York, after I left from Indianapolis when I went to New York to see my co-worker and my clients, and then I saw some Broadway Musical and, do you know Stump? <F>Err</F> make noise by newspapers or beep <F>uum</F> plastic bag or something, that kind of show. I saw that and I'm just interested in <R>th</R> this kind of performances now, so I wanna go some performance or plays or something <SC>in Tokyo</SC> even in Tokyo.</B>

<A>Could you describe this scene for me?</A>
<B>O K. <R>This is a</R> <F>uum</F> this is a classroom and <SC>it</SC> I think it's a mathematics class. And it is summer because almost all students <SC>have</SC> wears short-sleeved shirt. And the teacher is woman and wearing <R>glass</R> glasses. And half of them, no, just two student are very <F>um</F> hard to study about <??></??> mathematics or something. But almost all students are not so eager to study. Because some of them having chewing gum, and some of them chatting and some of them <SC>didn't</SC> <F>er</F> doesn't hear what teacher says and listen to the music and drinking something. So it's not good class, I think.</B>

And they are not so eager to study, because they have a lot of money, so they came here to <R>just</R> just play. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>Just time consume</SC> <R>just</R> just consume. So they are not so eager to study so almost all Saudi Arabian, chatting each other in the class or <SC>they want</SC> they didn't hear anything what teacher says <laughter>or</laughter> actually they hear some music or something. So I don't like the class. <CO><OL>This kind of</OL></CO>.</B>
