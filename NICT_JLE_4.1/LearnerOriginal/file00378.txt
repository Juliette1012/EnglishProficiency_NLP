And he dropped it. <.></.> And I stopped the car. And he <F>er</F> also stopped <F>er</F> his bike. He was very angry with me, <SC>ca</SC> although there is <R>no</R> no reason why I have to <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> say sorry. And, <F>er</F> soon, a policeman came by. And I explained all this to this policeman <.></.> that I was not guilty of this accident, <F>erm</F> <SC?>whatever</SC?> although <R>th</R> <SC>this young</SC> <F>er</F> this man was very angry with me. He was demanding <F>erm</F> the <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> compensation.

Then, <F>err</F> <F>mm</F> <nvs>snap</nvs> finally, I <F>mm</F> made <F>er</F> <F>erm</F> <F>mm</F> concession. <F>Err</F>. <.></.> <CO>And <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> I called a man <F>er</F> to <F>mm</F> this site and asked the man to fetch this <F>erm</F> broken bike which</CO>. <F>Oh</F>. <R>I</R> I think <F>i</F> <F>ur</F> <.></.> <F>em</F> <F>er</F> the bike was also <F>mm</F> were broken, so <F>mm</F> I asked <SC?>the</SC?> this another man to fix the bike.
