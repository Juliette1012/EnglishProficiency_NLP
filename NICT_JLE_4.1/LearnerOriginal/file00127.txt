<A>Hello.</A>
<B>Hello.</B>
<A>My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have your name please?</A>
<B>My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>

<B><OL>Nice to meet you</OL>.</B>
<A>Nice to meet you. How are you today?</A>
<B>Fine, thank you.</B>
<A>O K, good. Where do you live?</A>
<B>I am live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> prefecture.</B>
<A><F>Ah-huh</F>. So, how do you come to this place?</A>
<B>I take Shinkansen Express from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> station to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> station and transfer to local <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> Line.</B>
<A><F>Mm-huh</F> so, doesn't it take long time?</A>
<B>No. <F>Ah</F> <R>one na</R> one hour and twenty minutes. So this is kind of the same <F>ah</F> time for the people who are living in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> <R>ar</R> area.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> why did you decide to live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B>No. <SC>I just move</SC> <F>ah</F> I moved from <H pn="company name1">XXX07</H> to <?><H pn="others3">XXX05</H></?> head office, <F>mm</F> <R>in</R> in nineteen ninty-nine, <F>ah</F> sorry, <F>er</F> last year. And, when I was in <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>, I <R>built my</R> built my house, and my family is living in that my house. Therefore I cannot move <F>uh</F> the house. That means I have to commute to head office from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> <?>station</?>.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> I see. So, <F>ah</F> <F>u</F> do you take Shinkansen?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>Every morning?</A>
<B>Every morning and every evening.</B>
<A>So, how <?>are they</?> different from <F>ah</F> commuting with the, like Yamanote line <?>or</?>?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> usually from <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> to <H pn="others6">XXX09</H> station, <SC>I took</SC> I take <F>mm</F> <H pn="others7">XXX10</H> line or <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> line whichever, <F>ah</F> if the time is available <??></??>. <F>Eh</F> but, as far as I take, <F>uh</F> <SC>Shinkan</SC> <F>ah</F> <H pn="others7">XXX10</H> line, <?>it</?> is very, how can I say, <F>er</F> <SC>the</SC> <?>jammed</?>. <SC>People are very</SC> <F>er</F> how can I say, many people are in the same compartment. But, in case of Shinkansen, <R>I can</R> I can relax on the seat, so it is very nice.</B>
<A>I see. Could you tell me a little about <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B><CO><H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is</CO>. <F>A</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>ah</F>. Actually, <R>I</R> I have been living in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> for five years, <F>a</F> not five years, six years. And <R>my</R> <F>eh</F> my country is Kyusyu, so <SC>I'm not su</SC> <SC>I'm not so</SC> I'm not aware of <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city very well, but <F>mm</F> it is very nice city. And <SC>as you know</SC> as you may know that <H pn="others8">XXX11</H>. From <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, we can see the <H pn="others8">XXX11</H> and also <H pn="others09">XXX12</H> <OL>in the winter season</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Really</OL>? <F>Huh</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>eh</F> when we <F>eh</F> <SC>go to shopping</SC> go shopping in <JP><F>eeto</F></JP>, <H pn="others10">XXX13</H> or <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> by the train, so it is very convenient.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> I see. So, <F>ah</F> could you tell me about Kyusyu, your hometown?</A>
<B>Yeah. Kyusyu, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>hum</F> Kyusyu. What kind of <F>uhu</F> <R>s</R> story do you like to hear?</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Weather function</OL> or the people's nature. <CO>Or the</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <F>ah</F> like about your <F>ah</F> childhood.</A>
<B>Childhood? O K. <F>Mm</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> yes, O K. <F>Ah</F> when I was in Kyusyu, <F>uhu</F> in Kyusyu, <F>ah</F> maybe, you can imagine that there are many mountains <JP>ne</JP>. And <SC>Kyusyu is very</SC> <F>a</F> Kyusyu is a island, so <F>eh</F> my hometown is <F>uh</F> located near the riverside and also the mountainside. So I have <SC>five</SC> <F>er</F> four brothers, and usually I <SC>play</SC> played around with my <F>uh</F> brothers, <SC>mountain</SC> <F>ah</F> climb mountain and also fishing in the river. So <SC?>ma</SC?> <F>uh</F> when I was child, <F>uh</F> I was surrounded, <R>by</R> by the many natures. And that is <F>a</F> <SC?>th</SC?> totally different in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is located in the very flat land. So, <R>when</R> <SC>when ne</SC> when I try to go to mountain <SC>I have to take</SC> <F>uhu</F> I have to drive my car for <SC>more than <SC>one</SC> <SC>an</SC> one</SC> more than two hours <JP>ne</JP>.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F> I see.</A>
<B>Yeah. That is the totally different.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much.</A>
<B><nvs>cough</nvs></B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A><F>Eh</F>. O K. First, I'd like to show you a picture. O K. Please describe this place for me.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B><F>Hum</F>. What kind of description shall I tell you <OL><??></??> <?>I do</?></OL>?</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL> <R>any</R> any kind of description <F>ah</F> like imagine that I can't see the picture, and, please explain about the city.</A>
<B>About the city <JP>ne</JP>. O K. <F>Mm</F>. <.></.> <F>Mm-huh</F>. <.></.> O K. <F>Eh</F> this city is <F>ah</F> <SC>between the big</SC> <F>ah</F> <R>bet</R> between the river, and <F>uhu</F> there are one station, <R>tra</R> train station and <F>uhu</F> <F>uhu</F> banks in front of the station. It's <F>er</F> available and very convenient for the people living in this city. And also, <F>mm</F> <F>ah</F> very big supermarket is available, and, <F>er</F> near the supermarket, the movie theater is also. <F>Oh</F> you can enjoy the movie theater near the supermarket <JP>ne</JP>. <R>And</R> <F>hum</F> <.></.> and hospital and school and public library is also in the same line. So, when you try to, <F>uhu</F> go to the official, <F>uhu</F> how can I say, buildings or the <F>ah</F> governmental <F>uhu</F> buildings, it is convenient for you. <F>Hum</F>. <.></.> And <SC>there are</SC> <F>ah</F> this city has <F>uh</F> many <F>eh</F> greens, so <R>a</R> almost all the places you can see the trees <?>on</?> the buildings. And <SC>the</SC> in the <F>ah</F> bottom south of the city, <SC>there are</SC> <F>a</F> there is a big <F>er</F> route four hundred forty four. So <F>n</F> the inside the city, <F>ah</F> I guess there is not so, <F>oh</F> <F>mm</F> <F>ah</F> sorry, <F>ah</F> the <SC>route forty</SC> <F>eh</F> route four hundred forty four is winding in the south, so you can access this <F>uhu</F> big <F>er</F> route easily. <.></.> And, of course, <F>eh</F> you can take the train, and <SC>this train</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>sta</SC> <F>a</F> this station <SC>have</SC> <F>a</F> has six local lines, <F>eh</F> so <SC>you</SC> <F>er</F> five local lines, so, <SC>when you go</SC> <F>oh</F> <SC>to</SC> <F>uhu</F> when you are going to go anywhere you want, <F>uhu</F> you can take many kind of local lines.</B>
<A>O K. Do you think this town is well-developed?</A>
<B><F>Hum</F>.</B>
<A>Well-defined?</A>
<B>Yeah. I guess it is very well-designed <JP>ne</JP> because offices and banks <R>are</R> are building neighboring each other, and also, school and public library and hospital are also very close. So, this is very <F>eh</F> well-designed I think.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>What was the most important aspect, <F>ah</F> when you chose the place you built the house?</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Ah</F> school and hospital must be available <R>within</R> <F>eh</F> within, at least, twenty minutes <SC>by</SC> on foot, and also, the <R>su</R> supermarket should be located <JP>ne</JP> <R>nea</R> <SC>near</SC> around my house. And other things are not so important for me because we can take cars <??></??>. There are many bus and trains, <SC>so</SC> but, at least, <F>uh</F> when I consider my daughter, <F>ah</F> school and other public <F>uhu</F> offices must be <F>er</F> <?>or</?> should be closer for my daughter and my wife.</B>
