<A><F>Oh</F> right, right. So could you tell me a little bit more about the trip to Tokushima?</A>

<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I mean Tokushima</OL> branch, actually.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>So yesterday, <SC>we</SC> our <F>ur</F> meeting schedule was pretty tight.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><SC>I</SC> <SC>from</SC></OL> <R>ff</R> from eleven in the morning to probably twelve in the midnight,</B>
<A><OL><F>Wow</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>we just had</OL> really,really, in a way, I mean serious but <SC>frui</SC> very fruitful <SC>meeting</SC> I mean <F>er</F> discussion <OL>yesterday</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ohh</F></OL> that's nice. <F>Mhm</F>. I see. So now, <SC>when you are in</SC> you work for this <R>of</R> office in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>,</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>so <F>ur</F> tell me about your job <OL>a little bit</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>O K</OL>. I work for textbook research and development which we create the materials for our students. I mean English textbooks or workbooks and C Ds. Those like <F>ur</F> <SC>language materials</SC> English language materials for our students in <H pn="company name1">XXX04</H>. And also <SC>we create</SC> I mean, of course we research <SC>and</SC> <F>ur</F> the English language, and also create <R>the books</R> the books that we can sell at the book stores.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>So we develop actually <SC>the books</SC> <F>ur</F> the English language-related books.</B>
<A>So do you find any difficulties <F>ur</F> publishing or making that books, <OL>materials</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Oh</F> yes, <F>oh</F> yes</OL>. Tons of difficulties at the moment.</B>
<A><OL>Really</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>. For example?</A>
<B>For example, we have to suit our students' needs. And students, their levels also really <?>varied</?>. So we have to examine their need and <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> language knowledge. And, how do I say, we have to research really carefully about what students expect us <SC>to be provi</SC> <F>uh</F> <R>to</R> <R>to</R> <R>to</R> to make the really good quality textbooks. And then also, we have to examine our students' <F>ur</F> weakness. I mean, especially the Japanese language learners' weaknesses and maybe strength as well. So first, <SC>we have to really</SC> we have to be really careful what sort of <F>ur</F> needs out there in the market. Market, which means that our students. And then also, we have to make another books which appeal to <R>the</R> the various type of readers <SC>of</SC> I mean, in Japan.</B>
<A>I <OL>see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> it seems to be really close, but actually it's <SC>a bit diff</SC> I mean, <SC>really</SC> for us, really difficult to examine <SC>in</SC> for the various <R>re</R> readers. Readers means that they're not just students. And <SC>they</SC> you know, sometimes <R>their</R> their needs or their objectives <R>to</R> to kind of buy a book, especially related to <SC>language</SC> I mean English language is a bit different from the students. So we really have to kind of examine <R>the</R> <R>the</R> the purpose of the books and then the what kind of books that we have to create, which is <OL>quite difficult</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>. Sounds very difficult. But when you have free time,</A> 
<B><F>Mhm</F>.</B>
<A>what do you do usually?</A>
<B>Free time. <SC>I</SC> usually I clean my apartment, then kind of do the <laughter>dishes or do</laughter> the laundries and those kind of <F>ur</F> daily routines.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>Because since my <SC>work</SC> <F>ur</F> working schedule is quite tight, I mean from kind of noon to midnight. So</B>
