<B><H pn="others1">XXX03</H>? <F>Ur</F> actually, there is <F>urm</F> <H pn="school name1">XXX04</H>. It's quite, <F>ur</F> <laughter>you know</laughter>, a big university as you may know. <SC>And so <.></.> there're many</SC> and there are also many other schools. And so I guess there are many young people around <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Uh-hum</F>. And <F>urm</F> also, when I talked to my friends, they would say, "<F>Oh</F>. <CO>That's where <F>urrm</F> <H pn="others2">XXX05</H></CO>.".</B>
<A><F>Ohhh</F>.</A>
<B>You know the singer?</B>

<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><SC>it's</OL> kind of</SC> <F>well</F> it's nice and safe. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>. <OL><CO>I</CO></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> kind of active place. Very nice place to live.</B>
<A>I see. Do you live there by yourself?</A>
<B>No. I live with <R>my hus</R> my husband. <F>Urm</F> I actually moved to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> last summer.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So I'm fairly a new. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL>I don't know</OL></B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><?>around</?> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. But I'm enjoying my stay.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>Only problem is it's a little <laughter>far from</laughter>, you know,</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>urrm</F> the center of <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>.</B>
<A>I see. Right. <F>Er</F> can you tell me about your husband?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> yes. <F>Urr</F> <F>well</F> he is a <F>well</F> like called ordinary salary-paid man. <nvs>laughter</nvs> A very ordinary type. So he goes to work <F>er</F> every weekday, and it's very rare for him to go to work on weekends. But, <F>ur</F> <F>well</F> as usual again, he comes back home very late. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F> I see. So, what do you do on the weekends then?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <F>ur</F> usually, <F>urm</F> I don't have any profession of my own, but <F>urmm</F> I go to school in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H> which is the center of <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>, <SC>but</SC> so it's quite away from where I live. But, <F>er</F> mostly <SC>I</SC> <F>er</F> it's only twice a week, but I have to do some studies and things. So I'm maybe occupied with the school I go to.</B>
<A>I see. Right. And, what do you do in your free time, then?</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>free time I go to schoo</SC> <F>well</F> on weekends, sometimes I go tennis with my husband or, you know, sometimes we have to visit our parents. They're in <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>. <OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>You know</OL>, just <laughter>say hello</laughter> makes them feel comfortable. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> I see. <OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Ur</F> where did you live before you moved to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> actually, <F>urr</F> we were living in <H pn="others5">XXX08</H> <laughter>which was quite</laughter>, you know, in the central district.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>. <SC>And</SC> so it was quite convenient to go to school then. <OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhmm</F></OL> I see. <F>Uh</F>. What do you study at school?</A>
<B><F>Urmm</F> I go to this school which is <SC>ss</SC> <F>ur</F> supposed to be try to study about interpretation.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hmm</F>. But I'm really having a tough time not only with the English and Japanese language <SC>bit</SC> but, <F>ur</F> you know, with the things we do, political issues, economic issues, the vary things that happen. The logics.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>That's kind of difficult for me to study.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F>.</B>
<A>What is the most challenging thing about interpreting?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC>the thing is you have to</SC> <F>well</F> even if you listen in Japanese, and understand it, you have to really understand it by yourself. <F>Uh</F>. So, sometimes I do this Japanese-Japanese translation.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>.</A>
<B>Unless I really understand it, it's, you know, so difficult to just translate surface bit.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>. I see. All right. O K. Thank you.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K. First of all today, <SC>I want you to look at</SC></A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is choosing a picture.</ctxt>
<A><F>hmm</F> sorry, <.></.> O K, please look at this picture.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>O K? And can you describe the picture for me?</A>
<B>O K. So I guess this is somewhere, a skiing resort. And, <F>ur</F> <F>well</F> obviously, under left hand side, there are kids having fun <F>er</F> throwing snow balls. <F>Urr</F> I guess they are having a game. And also, up here, there is a couple having tea, probably it was cold outside so they are warming themselves up. And also, there are <F>urr</F> people enjoying skiing by groups, I guess. And also, as usual, people do <laughter>fall in snow</laughter>. And <F>urm</F> <F>oh</F> there is a snowboarding people. So I guess this ski <JP>gerende</JP> is not only for the skiers but also for the snowboarders as well. But, <F>uhm</F> seeing this, <F>urm</F> left here, there are so many people, so I guess this scene here is quite crowded, but maybe it's not so crowded on the other places.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Uhm</F>. O K. Thank you very much, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Do you do any winter sports?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> before I got married, I used to go <F>urr</F> skiing. But, nowadays, I don't. <F>Urm</F> it's rather going tennis with my husband on weekends. <laughter>He doesn't like the cold place</laughter>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><laughter><F>Oh</F> I see</laughter>. All right. <F>Uhm</F> which do you prefer, winter sports or summer sports?</A>
<B><F>Urmm</F> <.></.> <F>Uhm</F> I <.></.> guess <F>urr</F> <F>well</F> winter sports is fun, of course. But, you know, <SC>you get</SC> you need to get ready everything to go out into the cold. You know, you have to get <F>urm</F> so many sweaters and things of <?>many stuffs</?>. It's <R>ea</R> easier to do summer sports. You know, you don't have to wear so much things. So, in that way, I think summer sports is more convenient. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A><F>Ahh</F> I see. Right. O K. Thank you very much. O K. Now, let's do a role play.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>I'm going to give you a card. O K. Please read this card.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>O K? And, when you're ready,</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>I'll start.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Are you <OL>ready</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</B>
<A>O K. Hello. May I help you?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Urm</F> I have <F>urm</F> asked to be in this <F>urm</F> tour that you're arranging. But I found something that are quite different <SC>in the actual program</SC> in the actual agenda I've got from yours, compared to the pamphlet I had before.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Could you please tell me why this happened?</B>
<A>O K. Can you give me an example?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> yes. <F>Urr</F> <F>well</F> it says <F>er</F> the pamphlet <F>urm</F> that it would be <F>urm</F> <SC>collect</SC> <F>er</F> picking up us at the airport <F>urm</F> <.></.> with <R>a</R> a <SC>car</SC> <F>urm</F> individual car. But, from the actual <F>urm</F> <SC>agen</SC> <F>er</F> schedule we have here, it says you pick us up in a group in <R>a</R> a bus. <F>Urm</F> <.></.> why did this happened?</B>
<A>O K. <F>Well</F> there must have been <F>urr</F> some changes that currently would be <.></.> person who maybe agenda didn't realize. <F>Urrm</F> <.></.> first of all, we have some changes, but, now, we have decided that we'll pick you up at the airport <SC>by car</SC> <SC>by</SC> <F>er</F> sorry, by bus.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>. <F>Urrm</F> <R>well</R> <F>well</F> <SC>we were</SC> you know, my husband and I <SC>really planning</SC> <F>er</F> really looking forward to going this. <F>Urr</F> since it was our honeymoon, we wanted to be by ourselves. And that was something very disappointing for us. And, could you please do <SC>something</SC> <F>urr</F> an alternative arrangement or anything?</B>
<A>Sure. If you would like, we can offer you another tour.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A><F>Er</F> another individual tour.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>. <F>Urrm</F>. Would that cost something? <CO>Or</CO>. <F>Urm</F>. <.></.></B>
<A><F>Well</F> since it's one week prior to your <OL>departure</OL></A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</B>
<A>we would have to ask you for <F>urm</F> <.></.> a change fee, that's ten per cent</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>of the</OL> actual tour.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>. But, <F>urm</F> since the pamphlets and the actual thing here is different, and really we were expecting what this pamphlet was on, so <F>urm</F> <.></.> <SC>I</SC> honestly speaking, I think it's rather the fault at your agency. So, <F>urm</F> could you please consider a discount or something?</B>
<A>I see. <F>Well</F> I have to talk to the manager in that case.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>. <F>Well</F> please do consider it. <F>Urr</F> I mean really we don't want to, really, <F>urrm</F> bother you so much. But we want to make this trip very enjoyable and memorable one. And <F>urm</F> we don't want to have this <F>urr</F> ugly feeling. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>I see. O K. Then, let me talk to the manager, and I will contact you <F>er</F> tomorrow.</A>
<B>O K. I'll be looking forward to hearing from you.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. That's end of the role play.</A>
<B>O K. <OL>Thank you</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. So you were talking about your honeymoon.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Did you</OL> go to a honeymoon?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> yes, we did. But <laughter>we didn't</laughter> go on a very expensive tour or anything like that. We went Spain.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F>. But <F>urm</F> we just bought a very cheap, discounted <F>urm</F> air ticket, and then, we went to Spain, and met a friend there. And we arranged everything in Spain. So <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Ohh</F>.</A>
<B><SC>cost was</SC> it was very cheap.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Uh-hum</F>. But we did enjoy it.</B>
<A>I see. Were there any complications there?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> since we did make arrangements in Spain, <F>urm</F> we weren't quite sure, you know, what to do.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>And we were very busy because I was working at full-time at that time, and it's like just get on the plane. <laughter>We didn't have any plans</laughter>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B>So, in that way, we were like wondering what to do.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>.</A>
<B>But not much of complication. But only thing we were wondering was where were the Japanese people. <laughter>Because</laughter> we went to, you know, <F>urr</F> <.></.> parts where I guess usually it's not a major place. <F>Urr</F>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But it was fun.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>. That's good. <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>What did you enjoy most about your honeymoon in Spain?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> <F>well</F> it may be because we weren't on a group tour. <F>Ur</F> we were just wandering around town. Really we didn't have anything particular schedule, but we were just enjoying the scenery. And, you know, sometimes talking to the shopkeepers. And it isn't really anything special, but I just enjoyed that atmosphere.</B>
<A>Right. I see. It sounds really nice.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uhmm</F></OL></B>

</stage3>
<stage4>
<task>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. Thank you. O K. The last thing today.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I want you</OL> to look at another picture. O K. This is something that happened one day last week.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>So, please make a short story.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>O K? Using these pictures from one to six.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>. <OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>? When you're ready, please start.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures.</ctxt>
<A>O K?</A>
<B><F>Uh-hum</F>. So <F>urm</F> <SC>this man here</SC> he was just driving <F>urm</F> <.></.> <SC>as usual</SC> at daily routine. And then, <F>urm</F> from the other side, it came this <F>ur</F> motor scooter. And this guy was <F>er</F> actually speaking with his girlfriend on the cellphone. And then, just when this car was turning to the left, <SC>it was just closed</SC> <F>ur</F> it was just close about to hit this <F>ur</F> motorcycle. <F>Well</F> actually <F>urr</F> lucky enough, they didn't actually <F>urm</F> collide, but what happened was, he was, I guess, surprised, the person in the <SC>motor car</SC> <F>uh</F> motorcycle. And he dropped his cellphone. And, with this, <F>urrm</F> <.></.> <F>urr</F> shock <F>er</F> the cellphone hit the car. <F>Urm</F> it's just broken into pieces. And this person who was, <F>er</F> driving the motorcycle, he was quite angry because he was really having a really nice conversation with his girlfriend. And he just went up to the driver of the car and complained about his <F>ur</F> phone been broken. But, actually this driver himself wasn't very pleased of being accused because it wasn't really <F>er</F> his fault. <F>Well</F> some part, maybe, but not a hundred per cent. <F>Well</F> because the accident happened, they called the police, I guess, <SC>for evidence</SC> <F>urm</F> for getting their proof of the accident. And <F>urm</F> this person driving the motorcycle, he was still angry about the fact that his cellphone <SC>was crashed</SC> <F>urr</F> was broken. But <SC>the car</SC> the driver of the car <F>urm</F> <.></.> complained <F>urm</F> about <F>urm</F> <SC>his attitude</SC> <F>urm</F> the fact that he was actually <F>urm</F> <.></.> speaking on the phone <F>urm</F> while driving. <F>Urm</F>. The car driver complained this to the policeman. And <SC>what happened was</SC> of course, it's illegal to <F>urr</F> use your cellphone while you're driving. So what happened was, I guess, the policeman <F>urm</F> agreed to the car driver's <F>urm</F> <SC>agreement</SC> <F>er</F> argument. And <F>urr</F> the motorcycle was taken away. <F>Urm</F> <F>urm</F>. I guess it's a <F>urrm</F> way of punishment, I guess. <F>Uh-hum</F>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. Thank you very much. O K. So the cellphone <SC>has see</SC> <F>er</F> seems to be the cause of this accident.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Urm</F></OL> how do you think cellphones have changed <SC>our lives</SC> our way of lives in general?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> <F>uh-hmm</F>. <laughter>Actually</laughter> <SC>one of</SC> I'm one of those <F>urm</F> minorities <laughter>who don't have a cellphone</laughter>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Ohh</F> I see.</A>
<B>I guess it's quite weird. Most of my friends are very amazed that <R>I</R> I don't have a cellphone. But, <F>urrm</F> <SC>when I was in</SC> when I was a student, you know, <SC>most of the people <?>world</?></SC> there wasn't a cellphone to be used in, you know, general public. And <F>urm</F> I think the most convenient thing is, <F>urm</F> when you have to meet our friends,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>it's like <F>urrm</F> if you are late ten minutes or something, you can just call your friend and say, "I'm late. So just wait for another ten minutes.". <F>Urm</F> that's, <?>now</?> I think, happening today. People just, you know,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>call and inform each other. But, you know, <laughter>in the past</laughter>, <F>urm</F> like <F>urm</F> some <F>urr</F> dramas or something in T V program, it used be like <F>urm</F> this guy was waiting for his girlfriend, and his girlfriend was in the back of the tree or something.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And they couldn't meet each other. That kind of love story did happen in the past, I guess. But, nowadays, I don't think such things would happen.</B>
<A>I see. So, is that a good thing or a bad thing?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> it's of course very convenient. <F>Urm</F> but one thing I'm very concerned is like <F>ur</F> my father, <F>urr</F> he has a little problem with his heart.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uhmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Er</F></OL> he doesn't have a pacemaker at the moment, but <F>urm</F> the doctor said other day, "Why not consider one?".</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B>And, when I heard that, <SC>I don't know</SC> I know nothing about, you know, those medical things, but I was just wondering like when you are on the train, they would say, "Please turn off <OL>your cellphone</OL>.".</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>. Right.</A>
<B>Because <F>urm</F> it makes the pacemaker's thing <?>wrong</?>. Those kind of things are a little bit of a worry to me.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. I see. All right. O K. Thank you very much, <OL><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H></OL>.</A>

<B>For today? <F>Urr</F> <F>well</F> actually, <F>urr</F> <F>hmm</F> after this interview, I'll have my lunch, and then, I'll go to school.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see.</A>
