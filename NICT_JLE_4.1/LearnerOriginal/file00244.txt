<A>Nice to meet you, too. How are you today?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> not bad, thank you. And how are you?</B>
<A>I'm fine, thank you. <F>Urr</F> it's been warm today,</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>so what do you like to do in your free time?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>urrm</F> I'm not <F>urm</F> so active guy. So <F>urr</F> nothing <F>ur</F> particularly, but <F>urr</F> <F>well</F> <SC>this</SC> <F>urr</F> <SC>it's</SC> <F>uh</F> because it's <F>ur</F> getting <R>warm</R> <R>warm</R> and warm, so <R>I feel like</R> <F>urr</F> I feel like <F>urr</F> do <F>urr</F> <SC>jogging</SC> some joggings outside. But <R>it's</R> <F>urr</F> <R>it's</R> it's not sure <SC>I doing</SC> <R>I</R> <R>I do</R> I do it or not.</B>
<A><F>Uhhh</F> I see. Do you have a particular hobby?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> yes. <SC>I like</SC> <F>um</F> I'm interested in studying English. That's a main <F>urr</F> my <R>curiosity</R> <R>curios</R> curiosity. So <F>uh</F> I'm now digging in into <F>urr</F> studying English. That's <F>urr</F> only one, I'm doing now.</B>
<A>I see. What's your purpose to study English?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I want to be a interpreter. That's a main purpose.</B>
<A>I see. O K. So now <F>urr</F> could you tell me about your family?</A>
<B>Only I have a wife. That's all. <R>Two</R> <R>two</R> two persons.</B>
<A><F>Mhmm</F> tell me a little more about your wife.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <F>well</F> she is <F>urr</F> around <F>urr</F> thirty-four. <F>Urr</F> <SC>she is</SC> <F>urr</F> she used to be a housewife, but now she's taking a part time job. So maybe <SC>three</SC> <R>twice a</R> twice a week she go out side, and do job.</B>
<A>I see. O K. <F>Urr</F> by the way, where do you live?</A>
<B>I live in <F>urr</F> <F>urr</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> Ward. It takes <F>urr</F> maybe <F>urr</F> less than thirty minutes to get here. So I take a <SC>shoo</SC> <F>uh</F> <F>urr</F> <SC><H pn="others2">XXX04</H></SC> <F>uh</F> <R>no</R> no. <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> Line today and to get to the <F>urr</F> <?><H pn="others4">XXX06</H></?>-<JP>shi</JP> and <SC>take the</SC> <F>urr</F> exchange train to a <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> Line to get here.</B>
<A><F>Mhmm</F>. How was the atmosphere in the train today?</A>
<B>Train?</B>
<A>When you came here.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <F>mhm</F> <R>not</R> not so crowded than <F>urr</F> I expected. So maybe <SC>the</SC> if I go <SC>to the direction</SC> into the direction of Shinjuku, that <F>urr</F> atmosphere is much different, I suppose. But <F>urrr</F> <?>because</?> this is <F>urr</F> not <F>urr</F> that line, so maybe that's why.</B>
<A><F>Hmmm</F> so where it's crowded in the train, what do you usually do in the train?</A>
<B>Crowded?</B>
<A><F>Uh-hum</F>.</A>
<B><F>Wow</F>. If I stand where <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I don't, and I pushed <SC>around from</SC> around, so if that case <SC>I don't</SC> I have no choice but just standing. But otherwise <F>urr</F> maybe, I try to concentrate reading English <F>urr</F> materials.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. I see.</A>
<B>If I have a chance to sit. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>

<B><F>Urrrm</F> this is a party situation, I think. <F>Uh</F> not a party. I'm not sure. In a restaurants I <SC>su</SC> <F>uh</F> rather. And <F>urr</F> they are maybe <SC>a couple</SC> sweet couple. And <F>urr</F> <SC>he is trying</SC> they are trying to order some wine, bottle of wine. So <F>urr</F> some, it seems <F>urr</F> good atmosphere because <SC>that</SC> some piano's <F>uh</F> there. So maybe the background music <SC>is <F>urr</F> little sweet</SC> must be sweet. That's all. O K. That's all.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Mhmm</F>. So do you celebrate some special occasions with your wife?</A>

<A><F>Ohh</F>. How did you spend the day?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> usually I <SC>go to</SC> <F>urr</F> <R>go</R> go out eat dinner. <F>Urr</F> and <F>urr</F> <.></.> that's <F>urr</F> <F>well</F> I think <R>that's</R> that's all.</B>
<A><F>Hmmm</F>.</A>
<B>Sometimes I buy present <.></.> for her. But <F>ur</F> it's <F>urr</F> sometimes <R>it's</R> <F>urr</F> <R>it's</R> <R>it's</R> it's <R>in</R> <SC>included in the</SC> is <R>in the</R> in the price of the dinner. It depends on the price of dinner how much you've spend. So that's why <R>if</R> if it's <SC>not so expensive</SC> less expensive, I can sure get some gifts for her. But that's depends.</B>

<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures.</ctxt>
<B><F>Urrr</F> I make a story?</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>Umm</F>. <.></.> <F>Errr</F>. <.></.> <F>Well</F> when I was driving <SC>the car</SC> a car, <F>errr</F> a guy driving a motorbike was <F>urr</F> in front of me. <.></.> <SC>He seems</SC> <F>urr</F> <SC>he is</SC> <nvs>cough</nvs> <SC>he is <F>urrr</F> <F>urr</F> going</SC> he's going with <F>urr</F> <SC>mobile tele</SC> mobile phone. And <F>uh</F> <SC>he</SC> without <F>urr</F> him <nvs>cough</nvs> no way that we <R>c</R> crush each other. So <F>urrr</F> <R>I</R> I was very angry because it's obvious that he <F>urr</F> <SC>doesn't pay</SC> didn't pay attention <SC>to the</SC> to me. So I called the police, and <F>urr</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> explained to the policeman that <F>urr</F> <SC>this</SC>, the <SC>motor phone</SC> was, mobile phone was the cause of the accident. So <SC>he</SC> <F>urr</F> the police and <SC>the</SC> this person riding bike <SC>is</SC> <F>uh</F> <SC>understand</SC> understood. <F>Urrr</F> and <F>urrr</F> without <F>urrr</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <SC>excuse</SC> any excuse. <R>The</R> <SC>the bike</SC> his bike <R>was <F>urr</F> taken a</R> <F>urr</F> was taken away to the police station. And <F>uh</F> that person <SC>was</SC> <F>urr</F> <R>stood</R> <F>urr</F> stood up <F>uh</F> <F>urrr</F> <R>without</R> <F>urrr</F> without <F>urr</F> what you say <SC>with <F>urr</F> hope</SC> without any hope. That's the story.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Sure. O K. Thank you very much. <F>Urr</F> do you drive a car?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> I have a license. But <F>urr</F> <SC>I never</SC> <F>urr</F> <F>well</F> <R>I</R> I used to drive, but <F>urr</F> in these days, <F>er</F> those in <F>urr</F> two or three years, I don't drive.</B>
<A>Why not?</A>
<B>Because <F>urr</F> <F>well</F> actually, I was in the <F>urr</F> foreign country. So it's difficult and very dangerous to drive a car by myself. The secondly <F>urr</F> when I <F>urrr</F> <R>come</R> come back to Japan, I don't have car. I mean <F>err</F> I feel dangerous, drive a car because <F>urr</F> <F>well</F> <F>well</F> that is a one reason. The other reason is I can't afford to buy. So that's why I don't drive</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>nowadays.</B>
<A>O K. Now <F>urr</F> so you mentioned that you have lived in the other country <OL>right</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Right</OL>.</B>
<A>So could you compare the traffic condition</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>between that country you have <OL>lived before</OL>,</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A>and Japan?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> actually I was in <H pn="others6">XXX08</H>.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see.</A>
<B>That was <F>urr</F> you know, people <F>urr</F> very <.></.> recklessly <.></.> drives very much, you know. Actually car itself is <R>d</R> dirty. <R>Car</R> car <SC>itself are</SC> themselves are very old. So the car <SC>has</SC> itself <R>has</R> <R>ha</R> <R>ha</R> <R>has a</R> has a lot of problem. <R>And</R> <F>urr</F> and on top of that, the character of the person, <F>well</F> I can't say it to. <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I can't make it generalized, that <F>urr</F> <F>well</F> I feel, in my opinion, it's a character of the you know <H pn="others7">XXX09</H> person is <F>urr</F> kind of a <R>easy-going</R> <F>err</F> easy-going persons. Because <F>urr</F> then <F>urr</F> so <SC>whatever</SC> however I try to be careful to drive, you know, they don't care about, you know <SC>if I</SC> if they you know, just hit a little bit, they don't care. <F>Urr</F> "No problem", they say.</B>
<A><laughter><F>Wow</F></laughter>.</A>
<B>So <F>urr</F> <SC>that's <F>urr</F> real</SC> that totally different world.</B>
