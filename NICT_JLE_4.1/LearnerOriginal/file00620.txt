It seems <SC>this is</SC> <F>urrr</F> this house is quite big with big gardens. <F>Urm</F>. What's this? <F>Urr</F>. I guess this is the cat on the car. <.></.> It's a very sunny day, and I think this is in a daytime. Everybody's outside. <F>Urr</F>. Two womans are having a chat in the middle of the road.

</task>
<followup>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. <F>Uhm</F>. So, <.></.> can you compare</A>

<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urrr</F>. <.></.> My <F>urr</F> neighbors?</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>We don't have such kind of plenty of spaces. We don't have any gardens. We don't have any big roads. <F>Urm</F>. So <.></.> I think, compared to my areas, <R>this</R> <F>er</F> this areas shown the pictures is much more <.></.> <F>urr</F> easy to live, very comfortable live, I guess. Actually, my area is more crowded with houses, more many cars. <.></.> But <F>urr</F> <.></.> I don't see any people who <.></.> will be reading newspapers outside his house because there aren't any spaces in front of his house <laughter>in my area</laughter>. It's so tight. It's so crowded. So I think this is a <laughter>very nice area</laughter>, very expensive, I guess.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. <.></.> O K.</A>
<B>O K?</B>
<A>So, if it's so crowded, why did you choose that place?</A>

<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Because it doen't work well.</B>
<A><F>Uhm</F>.</A>
<B><CO>And reason it doesn't work well</CO>. <F>Urr</F>. I have done all the things on <SC>the</SC> <F>err</F> what is said on the papers. So it should be working <.></.> well, but it doesn't work well. So, could you change to another new products?</B>
<A>I am sorry. We don't have any exchange policy.</A>
<B>O K. Even though it's not working well? I think <F>urr</F> <.></.> because I bought this tape, it should work well, because it otherwise I can't use this tape. So I think <R>it's</R> it's not <F>urrr</F> very <.></.> good to say "It's only a policy.".</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Is it?</B>
<A><F>Well</F>. I'm sure that the tape recorder was working</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A>when I was sold it to you.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>. O K.</B>
<A>So I'm not sure why it's broken.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Urr</F> can I use this <F>urrr</F> guarantee? I think there's the guarantee for the product. May I use for it?</B>

<A><F>Ahhh</F>.</A>
<B><F>urr</F> actually.</B>
<A>What happened?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. It's hard to explain. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Hard to explain, but it's hard to understand that first time.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Because all it's English. <F>Er</F> <F>er</F>. The problem is more to the accounting side.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>.</A>
<B>So, <.></.> see if I was talking to American people, it's more easy for me to understand. But it's a people in India. So <R>they</R> they have a dialects, so it's very <SC>hard for me to understand</SC> hard for me to understood myself for them. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>So, what do you do in that kind of situation?</A>
<B>O K. First, I E-mail them, write on the paper, <SC>fax out</SC> fax it out, and I call them again and again. So <nvs>laughter</nvs> we have a bad relationship with that person. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
