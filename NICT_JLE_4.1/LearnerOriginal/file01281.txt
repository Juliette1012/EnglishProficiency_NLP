<A><F>Hm</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>because <nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> I have a husband and a son. I have to cook everyday. But when I go to restaurant, I don't have to cook. That's the most enjoyable <OL><laughter>part</laughter></OL>.</B>

<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>um</F> every time we go to restaurant, I bring <SC>some</SC> like toys. <OL><CO>Not toys <?>but</?></CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
