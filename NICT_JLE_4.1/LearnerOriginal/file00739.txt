<B>Yes.</B>
<ctxt>Interviewer is taking out a picture.</ctxt>
<A>O K. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, please describe this picture for me.</A>
<B>Describe this picture?</B>
<A><F>Uum</F>.</A>
<B>O K. It seems to be <SC>a school</SC> a classroom in <F>well</F> America or somewhere.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B>And the teacher is teaching the students mathematics, I suppose. And it seems to me that <F>er</F> there's only one guy in front of this teacher is listening. And the other guys are talking, chewing gums, drinking and doing their own business. You know? And it seems to be a school without uniforms.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B>Because they are wearing, yeah, their own clothes.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>well</F> <.></.> it's a bit sad situation for the teacher, I suppose.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. O K. Thank you.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Why you said you think it's a sad situation for the teacher? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Because it seems</OL> to <?>me</?> that there's only one guy who is <R>I mean</R>, listening.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B><?>And</?> she looks as if she is doing it hardly.</B>
<A><F>Uum</F>. <F>Well</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, can you compare the situation here, I mean, <F>er</F> <SC>at</SC> especially the attitudes of the students, to yourself when you were high school.</A>
<B>In my high school?</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>My high school? <F>Well</F> <SC>it</SC> actually, it depended on the teacher.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B>Strict teacher, I listen carefully. But most of the <.></.> class I did listen carefully, <R>I suppose</R> I suppose.</B>
<A>So you are saying that you were a good student.</A>
<B>Yes. Sometimes I was tired because of football.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>I was doing my club everyday except for Thursday.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>.</A>
<B>So maybe I might have been gone to another world. <CO><R>But</R></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>but I suppose I</CO>.</B>
<A>O K. <R>If</R> if there is <R>any a</R> any advice to this, looks like young teacher,</A>
<B>Yes. <OL>Young teacher</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>wha</R></OL> what is your suggestion to her.</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> <CO>I</CO>.</B>
<A>For how to change the students' attitudes.</A>
<B><SC>I</SC> it must be a very hard thing to do. But <.></.> I think she must use not full time teaching the thing she have to. But she must use the part of time to <SC>communicate same common</SC> you know, <.></.> about <R>talk</R> talk about the same common thing.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>.</A>
<B>And <R>co</R> communicate them. Know each other better, I suppose.</B>
<A>I see. Good. O K. Good. And what do you think of <F>well</F> the school system that most of the Japanese schools are <.></.> having uniforms but this is not? Which is better, do you think?</A>
<B><F>Uum</F>. Much I don't care of about. <F>Er</F> I used to go to high school <R>wh</R> which you can wear uniform and both your own clothes.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see.</A>
<B>So you could choose.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>.</A>
<B>But I don't mind. I don't think <?>it's a</?> big problem about uniform.</B>

<B><F>Err</F>. But the reason why I came late here was <R>the</R> <.></.> <SC>the one</SC> the train that I get on before got late. So <SC>it's</SC> I think it's part of the <.></.> <SC>train's</SC> <F>er</F> <R>company's</R> <F>err</F> company's problem, I suppose.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>. <F>Well</F> <F>eh</F> <F>eh</F> was there any accident on the way?</A>
<B>I don't know. But it stopped and it didn't move as usual. <F>Er</F> so I came here late for my <?>next</?> train.</B>
