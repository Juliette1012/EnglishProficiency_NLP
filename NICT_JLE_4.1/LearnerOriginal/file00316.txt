And the teacher seems to be <F>ah</F> very concentrated on <F>ah</F> teaching. <F>Ah</F> <SC>he</SC> she is a mathematic teacher. But <F>ah</F> <R>most</R> most of the students <SC>are</SC> aren't concentrated on studying. <F>Ah</F> in the front line, a boy is <F>ah</F> looking outside, chewing gums. And <F>ah</F> in the back, <F>ah</F> two girl are talking <SC>about</SC> <F>ah</F> probably <R>about their</R> about their friends or <F>ah</F> going out after school, like that. And <F>er</F> next to them, a boy is drinking a kind of sports drink or something. And only one boy is <F>ah</F> listening to <F>er</F> the teacher's talking.
