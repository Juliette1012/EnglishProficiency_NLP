<B><F>Ah</F> it's quick. I usually spent about five to ten minutes for lunch.</B>
<A>Only for that?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>Then, what do you do during lunch break?</A>
<B>Go back to office to work. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. You are so busy.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> yes, I am. <F>Well</F> everybody in the office is.</B>
<A><.></.> I see. Then, how you release the stress from work?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> I go fishing almost every weekend. And I forget everything about the work.</B>
<A><F>Ha</F>.</A>
<B>That's how I <F>er</F> <F>erm</F> remove stress from me.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> that's good. Fishing?</A>
<B><OL>Fishing, yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL> are there any fishing spots near <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>

<B><F>Well</F> I go back home, clean the fish. And I serve <JP>sashimi</JP> <R>and</R> and cooked fish to my family.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B>It's my wife's holiday.</B>
<A>That's great. <laughter>O K</laughter>. Then, please tell me about your family a little bit.</A>
<B><F>Am</F> I have one wife. <F>Er</F> I lived in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> in the past but I only have one wife,</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>and</OL> daughters sixteen and fourteen. <.></.> And elder one go to a high school. And <F>er</F> she doesn't want me in home on weekends. And that's is probably one of the reasons,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>I go fishing</OL> on Saturday, stay away from home. <?>Yeah</?>.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> but why do you think <R>she</R> she doesn't want you to be home?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> if her father is in home, he would tell her "Do this, do that, would you prepare tea for me?". <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>And she doesn't like it. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K. O K. Then, <F>ah</F> don't you think about going out with her?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> not in the next couple of years. <F>Er</F> at the age of sixteen, girls do not want to <F>ur</F> go out with <F>em</F> their fathers. <.></.> I think you have the same experience in the past, have you? <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. No. Not really. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. <F>Hm-hmm</F>. <F>Er</F> by the way, <F>erm</F> how long have you been working in this company?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. Twenty-three years. I think I joined here in nineteen seventy-eight. Twenty-three years. Probably too long. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Ah</F> no, no. I don't think so. Then, have you worked in a different office? Outside <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B><F>Ar</F>. Yes. <F>Er</F> I once <F>em</F> <??></??> to <??></??> in U K and I worked there for eighteen months. <R>And</R> and besides that, <F>er</F> I stayed in the head office excluding one year when I was in sales in nineteen eighty-four to eighty-five.</B>
<A>So what was the most difficult thing in the U S?</A>
<B>In the U S? <F>Ah</F> how do you know I was in the U S? <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><CO><F>Ah</F> did you say United</CO>.</A>
<B>U K.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> U K. Sorry.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> sorry. I might have said U S, but <F>er</F> I worked in the U K. But <F>er</F> the most difficult thing for me,</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and when I was in the U S? <F>Oh</F> <R>it wa</R> <F>er</F> it was when I was student, I lived in the States for four and half years. <SC>And difficult thing</SC> <F>well</F> <SC>livin</SC> <F>erm</F> I should not mention about religion. <nvs>laughter</nvs> One of the places I lived in the States was <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> <.></.> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> is a very religious place. <SC>And</SC> but I smoke a cigarette and take alcohol and these are not accepted by the people in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. Majority of the people there are Mormons.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <OL>I see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>And</R></OL> and the student life there <F>er</F> was very different. And it wasn't very easy for me to live there.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Mh-hmm</F>. O K. Thank you. I understand.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>Now,</A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is taking out a card.</ctxt>
<A>O K, so please take a look at this. And please the picture for me.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> this could be my daughter's life in school. <F>Well</F> teacher is <SC>doing some</SC> <F>er</F> teaching mathematics. But students are doing something else. And <F>oh</F> one of them is playing with the mobile telephone. And I think this is probably what my daughters are doing in school. <.></.> Do you want to hear more about this?</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Yes. <F>Hm-hmm</F>. <F>Oh</F> O K, then, <F>er</F> so why do you think they are not concentrated on the class?</A>
<B><.></.> <F>Erm</F>. If I may talk about politics, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>well</F> the government, <F>er</F> I think it is the failure of the Japanese Ministry of Education. <F>Erm</F> the method of teaching children. And <SC>teachers</SC> <SC>I don't want</SC> before the war, teachers are very <F>er</F> prestigious job. But after the war, probably after <R>nineteen s</R> <F>mmm</F> nineteen seventy or eighty <F>em</F> <R>teachers</R> <.></.> teachers are under pressure <.></.> not to get too close to students. And teachers started thinking about their job as one of the many jobs available. And the relationship between teacher and students, <F>erm</F> <.></.> I'd say in a way, has been destroyed. And students or pupil here don't trust teachers. And teachers don't know how to deal with <F>erm</F> <SC>children</SC> <??></??> children.</B>
<A>Then, Mister <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, if you were the teacher, what would you do in this class?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> get closer to the kids. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> <F>well</F> teachers are not to teach what they teach, what they have. They are responsible to teach how to live in the society,</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>erm</F> I think this is what is missing <F>er</F> in many teachers today.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> <SC>they are just</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> they just think have a <F>erm</F> permanent job which is very secure. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>I see. So you think teachers are not respected <SC?>for <?>it</?></SC?> by students.</A>
<B>That's my prejudice. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Yeah. O K.</A>

<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<B><F>Erm</F> this is a difficult one.</B>
<A>Yes. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>

<B>Yes. I missed my train. My train left the station five minutes ago. Could I get a refund?</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. I'm sorry. <F>Er</F>. It's against our policy.</A>
<B><.></.> <F>Erm</F>. Could I take a later train, then?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. Yes you can take. But you have to buy another ticket.</A>
<B>It's not very nice. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Erm</F>. <..></..> <F>Well</F> I paid ten thousand yen for ticket. And you are telling me <F>well</F> <F>er</F> this has no value now. <F>Well</F> it's only five minutes. It's not fair.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. But the ticket is only <F>er</F> valid for that train which <F>er</F> had <F>er</F> already left.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> but the next train is not full yet. There must be a <SC>room</SC> seat available in that train. Can I get that seat?</B>
<A><F>Er</F> but why were you late? Why did you miss the train?</A>
<B><F>Well</F>. <F>Erm</F>. When I left home, I was waiting for a bus and <SC>bus</SC> the bus was involved with a traffic accident. And there was no way I could get to the station by time.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <R>You should have</R> you should have left <F>er</F> earlier.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. I usually leave home two hours before the office start. I usually leave very early in order not to miss the train.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>. O K. Then, <F>er</F> let me talk to my manager.</A>
<B>Yes, please.</B>

<B>Yes.</B>
<A><SC>and</SC> <F>er</F> especially in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. And <F>er</F> what do you do?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I change the train. <F>Oh</F> <SC>they</SC> <F>er</F> <R>e</R> experience I had in September last year. <F>Er</F> typhoon hit Tokyo. But I was on my way to Singapore. And <SC>J R</SC> <SC?>or</SC?> a signboard on a street hit J R <F>er</F> power line and train stopped. And I had to change the train from J R to a private train. And the similar thing happened to me. <F>Ah</F> the private <F>er</F> railroad said to me <F>er</F> "The ticket is no good. And if you <R>wa</R> want a refund, I had to <F>er</F> take J R.". And if I did, <SC>the train</SC> <F>er</F> I get to the airport late. So <R>I had</R> I had no choice but not taking the refund and pay the additional charge to take the private train.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. <F>Erm</F>. Did you claim it to the company?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. Yes. <OL>I did</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>. O K. And you got a refund?</A>

<A>Now, I'd like to show you one more picture. O K. Please take a look at this. This time, please make a short story,</A>
<B><nvs>sniff</nvs></B>
<A>based on these six pictures. But this happened before, so please start your story with "One day last week".</A>
<B>One day last week. <.></.> When I was driving a car on weekend last week, I was involved with a traffic accident. A motorbike was coming in front of me. And the driver was making a phone call with his mobile phone. And that motorbike hit my car. But <F>er</F> the <SC>motorbike</SC> driver of the motorbike complained me. <.></.> So I had to telephone the police. And <SC>he came</SC> <F>er</F> the police came. And I explained what exactly happened. <..></..> And I left the place. And <SC>the motorcar</SC> motorbike was taken to a garage.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. Thank you, Mister <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Have you ever been involved in a traffic accident?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F>. When I was twenty-three was the last time. And nearly thirty years ago?</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. O K. And could you tell me the right procedure when you got involved the accident?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> if I ever get involved with an accident, the first thing I will do would be to call the insurance company and then police.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I would trust insurance company more than I trust police. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Why? <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Well</F>. <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> Insurance company would take care of me. Police, I don't think they would. <F>Erm</F>. Sometimes they don't <R>come to</R> <F>er</F> come to us. <F>Well</F> they would say they are too busy. And <R>the</R> <F>er</F> they would come to accident if it's a very serious one. But if it's a <SC>damage</SC> small damage to the car, they wouldn't bother.</B>
<A>I see. But actually, policemen are public servant. <OL>O K</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A>So what should people do to change those bad policemen.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> we should complain the police. <nvs>laughter</nvs> But I have <R>ne</R> never done it.</B>
<A><F>Hm-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>cough</nvs></B>
<A>Yes. But <F>er</F> what should people do to change this kind of a policeman? They are public servant.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>They are supposed to work for people.</A>
<B>Right. <F>Erm</F>. <F>Well</F>. We as a resident of the community, continuously <F>er</F> complaining the police. But complaining is not a Japanese traditional culture. They tend to stay quiet. And <SC>it is</SC> <F>er</F> <R>but I think</R> <F>er</F> but I think Japan is changing. And people are becoming noisier to the public servant. And Japan will change very soon.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. O K. All right. So maybe we should change,</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>to</OL> change them. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
