<A><OL>O K</OL>. What do you do?</A>
<B>I'm a English teacher. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Yes.</B>
<A><F>Urr</F> could you tell me about your students?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. <F>Well</F> I teach <F>urr</F> the kids from the two years old <nvs>laughter</nvs> to until about twelve years old, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>mm</F> so <F>urr</F> two or three-year-old kids <F>urr</F> comes with their mothers.

<A>Yeah.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Well</F> but I think it's difficult to take care the varieties of the kids, so what's the most difficult thing to <OL>teach them</OL>?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> <F>hm</F> <F>hm</F>. In the baby class, two or three kids <F>urr</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I will</SC> <F>urr</F> all the class is only in English <SC>so</SC> <F>urr</F> and the baby class is easy for me because I will <F>urr</F> say from me, they just listen and copy me. But in the older students <F>urr</F> they want to speak Japanese, so <F>urr</F> if I ask in English, they answer in Japanese. So <F>er</F> if they don't know the meaning of the words, I have to <F>urr</F> explain in English <F>urr</F> step by step. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So if I explain in Japanese, it's very easy <laughter><R>but</R></laughter> but they don't remember the English words at all if I explain in Japanese, so <F>un</F> that's very <F>hm</F> <R>just</R> just the words "to listen", <SC>they</SC> if they don't understand the "listen" "<R>What</R> what is listen, <laughter>please tell me in Japanese</laughter>.".
