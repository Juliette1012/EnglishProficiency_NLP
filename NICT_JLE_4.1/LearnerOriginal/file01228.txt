<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>. Can you tell me the reason why you <OL>think so</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><??></??></OL> he's talking on the phone.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>From picture <SC?>it's li</SC?> it looks like the car crashing with the bike, so</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. All right.</A>
<B>maybe the car could have been more careful.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. Right. I see. <F>Um</F> I think you yourself use cell phones, of course. And <F>well</F> what's the difference between talking on the cell phone to <F>um</F> writing E-mail to your friends?</A>
<B><SC>Cell</SC> talking on the cell phone?</B>
<A>The phone or writing E-mails. <CO>So these days people use both <F>er</F> ways of communication <OL>to</OL></CO></A>

<A>Right.</A>
<B><?>I think it's</?> E-mail.</B>

<B>Maybe writing E-mails are a lot cheaper.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>And maybe <SC>you jus</SC> you can just talk when you are free. On the phone,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>it cost more.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> both of them have to be, like you know, free in time to talk <OL>a lot</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>. Right.</A>
<B>But E-mails are like you can <?>out</?> back reply when you have time.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><??></??></B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. So you prefer E-mail. Really?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> like if you talk to friends in schools, maybe <SC>it's</SC> <SC>I can just</SC> I just E-mails but <SC>when you</SC> if you don't meet that someone a lot, you don't talk to he or her <OL>much, and</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>maybe phone is better.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Uh</F> but he's like far away, maybe E-mails.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> yeah. It could costs a lot. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>Right</laughter>.</A>
