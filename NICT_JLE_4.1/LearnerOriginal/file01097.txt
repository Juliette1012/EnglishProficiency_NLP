<A><F>Mhm</F>. O K. What do you mean by smart <laughter>colleagues</laughter>?</A>

<B>I'm from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City. I live in just close to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> Station. Ten minutes walk.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. Isn't it nice city to live?</A>
<B>I don't think so</B>
<A><OL>You don't think so</OL></A>
<B><OL>because</OL> too busy place to live in, I think. Very convenient, but a lot of drunker. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Then what kind of place would you prefer to live?</A>
<B><SC>Like</SC> how can I say, like traditional town <SC>walking</SC> <F>mm</F> <R>old</R> old lady's walking like, how can I say, and <F>mm</F> <OL><R>morning</R></OL> morning market.</B>
<A><OL><R>You mean like Kyoto</R></OL>. <F>Oh</F> you mean like Kyoto or <OL>what's tradition</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Uum</F></OL> I mean just I want to live with <F>ur</F> how can I say, <R>na</R> natural living like, <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City is very brand new, very changing every time. And <F>er</F> almost all shops are focussing on young people. So we can't see any old people there.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>It's very <SC>weird</SC> strange for me.</B>
<A><F>Uhu</F>. <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><??></??></OL> sometimes uncomfortable. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>I see. O K. So you're now living with your parents?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>O K. Tell me about your family.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Mhm</F> I have only child, and <??></??> <SC>I live in my mother</SC> I live in with my mother and father and me. And <R>my</R> <.></.> my father is working for the company dealing with Japanese traditional pictures, vases, traditional products. And he is the president of that company, working very hard, I think. And my mother, she also has a job, and <F>ur</F> she is <F>ur</F> public servant working for <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see. Do you respect your father?</A>
<B>Yeah, of course.</B>
<A>Of course? <F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><R>In</R></OL> in <F>ur</F> what way?</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F> in what way? <SC>He's</SC> he seems very professional for his job. And <F>ur</F> he is very good at with me and with my mother, too. So maybe his sense of balance, job and family is very good, I think.</B>
<A>Good. Thank you very much.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>Then now, I will show you a picture.</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A>So could you describe this picture for me?</A>
<B>O K. It's the picture of the class. And <F>ur</F> the <SC>lady</SC> woman teacher is teaching mathematics, I think. And <F>ur</F> <SC>students</SC> <.></.> there're some students on the picture, <SC>and</SC> but almost all of them are not caring for the teacher. Just one boy student's listening carefully and taking the notes. But the speaking of others, they're like just talking <R>with</R> with their friends, and drinking something, and listening music, and e-mailing by cell phone something like that. <R>It's</R> it's not good class, it seems. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>It's like</SC> <F>ur</F> maybe it's class of junior high school, but they don't wear the uniforms. <?>That's all</?>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. Were you wearing uniform when you were junior high school student?</A>
<B>Yeah,</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>I was.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. Which is better for you?</A>
<B>What do you mean? <CO><OL>Which</OL></CO>?</B>
<A><OL><F>Ur</F> wearing</OL>, O K.</A>
<B>Casual and uniform?</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. Yeah. What do you think about <SC>the</SC> their wearing uniform in the junior high school?</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F> I think it's good to wear uniforms because I don't need to care about <laughter>the clothes</laughter>. Because when I was junior high, I don't have enough money to select clothes so uniform maybe help me a lot.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. <F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
<B><OL>Easier <??></??></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Then can</OL> you compare this classroom to the classroom you had when you were a junior high school student?</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>. It depends because <F>mm</F> in my junior high school days, <F>urm</F> I have some special <SC>system</SC> school system in my school. It's like I don't have home class. <F>Mhm</F> instead, <F>ur</F> <SC>I had like</SC> <F>ur</F> I had class selected by the ability. Like I have English class and mathematics class, something like that. And each class is the different. Its teachers are different, and its each classmate are different. So it depends. So like very boring class, it was almost same as this picture. But sometimes <R>very</R> <R>very</R> very strict teacher, we were listening to the strict teacher. So it <??></??> depends. Yeah.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Well</F> do you think, in this picture, that students don't care about the teacher? What's the reason, do you think?</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F> I think teacher is not so good maybe. It seems she's speaking to the black board, not speaking <SC>to the</SC> to students. So she has some problems, too, I think.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much.</A>
</followup>
</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A>All right. Then now, I will show you a card. So please read it. <CO>And then when you're ready</CO>.</A>
<B>Read in English?</B>
<A><F>Uhh</F> I think Japanese</A>
<B>Japanese?</B>
<A>is O K. Yeah.</A>
<B><CO>Invitation is</CO>.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <?>just to yourself</?>.</A>

<A>But you could you know, make a phone call.</A>
<B>Yeah. I'm so sorry, but I was so upset, you know. It was so, how can I say, it was very unspecial <SC>un</SC> that <R>I</R> I couldn't expected. I was so upset so I just forgot about the party. Not forgot, like <R>I</R> I couldn't have a space in my mind.</B>
<A>But I know you have a cellular phone.</A>

And I just look around it, and found a box. And inside the box, <F>urm</F> there was a small cat inside. And she was so cute. And my girlfriend also <R>liked</R> <R>liked the</R> <SC>liked the cat</SC> liked her. And my girlfriend pick up the cat, and asked to me to bring the cat to our house. We are living together. But I said I can't do that because we are living in the apartment. The owner of the apartment <R>will</R> will not allow us to have a pet. But <SC>she</SC> my girlfriend is really wanted to <F>urm</F> <SC>have a</SC> have that cat. She was really liked her. <F>Mhm</F> she couldn't stop <R>to</R> to hope it. So <.></.> I was just thinking, and <SC>I just</SC> <F>um</F> she said <R>she</R> she will take care of that cat all time by herself. So I just decided to take the cat to the home, and live together.

<B>Lovers, but not <F>ur</F> wife and husband. Like living before the marriage. Very close. But not married.</B>
<A><F>Ur</F>. O K. I see. Then <F>mm</F> what would you do if you found a stray cat on the way back home tonight, in your case?</A>
<B><F>Urrr</F> you know, I like the cat very much. And <F>ur</F> <.></.> I really want to have a pet, but because I live in the apartment so <R>I</R> <SC>I can't take it to the cat</SC> I can't take the cat to the home. So maybe I will <SC>call some</SC> call to some friends of mine, and like if they have a space to have a pet. And <R>even</R> <R>even</R> even though I couldn't find the friends, <R>I</R> I just need to leave her there, I think.</B>
<A>Don't you feel guilty about that?</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F> not guilty because <SC>I don't have</SC> <F>ur</F> I can't afford to do it. I'm not the person who care the cat. Maybe she will be not happy when I take it to home.</B>
