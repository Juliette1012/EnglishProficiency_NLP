<B>The only thing I hate is the cold and the flu.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>In my</SC> <SC>everyone in my office</SC> almost everyone in my office is suffering from the cold.</B>

<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>

<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. <F>Mhm</F>. O K. So <F>urm</F> <F>mm</F> what is the interesting part of <F>ur</F> <OL>taking part in that activity</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Ur</F> yeah, it's very challenging, you know</OL>. <F>Urm</F> I would say it's always difficult to construct new curriculum or new <F>ur</F> English text books.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>Or new corresponded course project.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>But particularly it's very difficult, almost impossible <F>urm</F> <F>er</F> to design a suitable course of <F>um</F> speaking course project</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>for everyone.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>But we have consulted many scholars like the Professor <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> from <H pn="school name1">XXX05</H>,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>

<A><F>mm</F> what do you do to make yourself happy?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><?>honestly</?> when I talked to you last time two years ago, I think I said I like to play the clarinet or saxophone.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F> yes.</A>
<B>But because of the having difficulty, you know, <SC>I decide</SC> I stopped playing the saxophone or clarinet.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>.</A>
<B>Instead, I started picking up playing the blues harmonica.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><R>About a year</R> about a year and half ago.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>You know <SC?>how fun</SC?> <R?>how</R?> how is the blues harmonica like?</B>
<A>No.</A>
<B>It's very small. It got only ten holes.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> we use blues harmonica to play blues <OL>or jazz</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL> <F>mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And it's very cheap.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> you can play it anywhere.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>So that's what I do for my spare time</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>er</F> to relieve myself <OL>or to <?>go</?> refresh up <?>a little</?> from</OL> life and work.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. <F>Ahh</F>. So you play that inside your home or you go somewhere?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> in the park.</B>
<A>In the park. <F>Oh</F> O K.</A>
<B>You can play it anywhere.</B>
<A>True. <nvs>laughter</nvs> All right. So can you describe the <F>ur</F> park that you like to go to?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> do you know, now I live in <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>, and the in <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>, there are many parks. <F>Urm</F> the name is, <F>ahh</F> <F>er</F> <SC>how should I ex</SC> how shoud I translate that, <F>urm</F> the <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>, the park is called.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And in the park, <F>urm</F> <SC>you can find</SC> I mean, you can just <SC>by</SC> <F>ur</F> become yourself in the middle of the night. And the I practice about twenty minutes to thirty minutes everyday before I go home.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>But on this Sunday, <F>ur</F> I'll be moving <SC>to</SC> <SC>from <H pn="others5">XXX08</H></SC> <F>uh</F> from <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> to <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Probably I'll go to <H pn="others6">XXX09</H> Park</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>to practice my blues</OL> harmonicas.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>. O K. <OL>Are you excited</OL> about the move?</A>
<B><OL><CO><??></??></CO></OL>. That's right.</B>
<A>Yes? <F>Mm</F>.</A>

<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>But from next week, that will be less than an hour.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F> great. <nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. Thank you.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>So first of all, let me show you this picture.</A>
<B>Right. Yes.</B>
<A>And <OL>please</OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL></B>
<A><F>ur</F> tell me what you see in this picture.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F> I can see some animals and people. They're both females and males. And there some buildings, trees, and a road and car. Park? No, no, no, no. The white car.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>Then what else? The sun and the <?>road</?>.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. What's happening?</A>
<B><SC>It seems that the</SC> <SC>it's about probably</SC> this <?>scene</?> express, <F>urm</F> I would say on Sunday</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>on weekends</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>because</OL> you can see this gentleman. <F>Urm</F> if this happen during the weekdays, probably <F>urm</F> those two people won't be here.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>.</A>
<B>Because they will be go out <R>to go to</R> to go to work.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I think that is <SC?>the</SC?> a scene from Sunday morning perhaps because people <F>ur</F> tend to jog in the morning,</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>early afternoon. <F>Er</F> the <SC>sun is <SC>too</SC> prett</SC> sun is pretty high. And everyone seems to be quite relaxed.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So since you're moving,</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>urm</F> you know, the surroundings will change. But could you compare</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>ur</F> the place that you live now with the <SC>p</SC> new place you are going to move to next week?</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Ur</F> now, I live in a apartment. And the apartment is quite small. I mean, the whole apartment. There're only about really <R>ten</R> <R>ten to</R> ten to twelve rooms in the in the whole apartment.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>but the new place is, <F>urm</F> I would say</SC> <F>ur</F> I think in American English, probably you don't use the term for apartment for this <SC>highs</SC> <F>urm</F> <R>skyscra</R> skyscraper-like building.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>But in Australia or English, probably people say <F>urm</F> <F>oh</F> city apartment, something like that.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>There <SC>we</SC> more than I would say, fifty or sixty rooms in the big <SC?>barg</SC?> apartment. But the I would say, <F>ur</F> the most important thing for me is the security.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><H pn="others3">XXX06</H> is a very high risk area in terms of crime.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>. <F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>But on the other hand, <SC><H pn="others7">XXX10</H></SC> compare to <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>, <H pn="others7">XXX10</H> is pretty safe, <OL>I think</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. <F>Mm-hm</F>. I see. So how did you find this new apartment?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> actually <SC>that f</SC> <F>ur</F> the apartment or flat my no, no, no, <??></??> how do you say the apartment, flat?</B>
<A>laugther</A>
<B>What's the <R>proper</R> proper term for, in Japanese, we use <JP>manshon</JP>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>But I don't know the equivalent term in American English.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> that is owned by <F>um</F> somebody whom I know.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah, that's why I <??></??> him two hundred, pretty cheap in terms of rent.</B>

<A>Yes.</A>
<B>But the surprisingly I wasn't able to have breakfast. <SC>Becau</SC> and the hotel employee said that breakfast is not included. And the I ended up paying the <R>extra</R> extra fifty or sixty dollars to the hotel.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>So I'd like you to explain what exactly</SC> I mean <R>I don't</R> I don't want to use the word, reimbursement,</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>but <SC>I'd like to have some</SC> I have to have some kind of explanation from you guys.</B>

<A><OL>O K</OL>. O K.</A>
<B>I'm really sorry for <OL>saying that <??></??></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> no, no, no, no, no</OL>. It's just that I think it's better to check what actually happened at the hotel. Maybe there was some <OL>miscommunication</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
