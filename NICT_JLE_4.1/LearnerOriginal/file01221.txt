<B><OL>O K</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>And tell</OL> me about the picture.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> this is a classroom with <F>um</F> <SC>a <SC>w</SC> lady</SC> a teacher teaching. I think it's a math class. But <SC>not many people</SC> not much students are listening because I can see people who are <F>um</F> eating gum and looking out the window and girls chatting. And she has her makeup on her desk and the mirrors. And there are a boy who is listening to music, he's drinking <F>um</F> soda. <SC>But there are few students who are listening because I can see a boy who's taking notes and a girl who's using</SC> <F>er</F> <F>um</F> only a boy is listening to a teacher because I can see he is taking a note. But a boy next to him is, <F>um</F> I think, doing E-mails by using his cell phone. And <.></.> <F>um</F> I think that's <OL>about it</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yeah, thank you</OL>, <OL><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. <F>Hm</F>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right. <F>Er</F> please compare this picture with your classroom. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Um</F> <CO>I think our classroom is much better because we don't chew our gums and <SC>our</SC> <F>well</F> <SC>we</SC> maybe some people are chewing gums but they don't show like they don't</CO>. <F>Um</F> and we don't drink soda or any drinks during class. And <F>um</F> although we do some discussions, <R>we are not</R> we are not gonna chat and we don't have our makeup out in our desk. And we are never gonna listen to our music when you have class.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. <F>Hm</F>. Do you like mathematics?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> not <laughter>very much</laughter>.</B>
<A>O K. But <F>um</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> what should she do to attract <F>er</F> more students' attention?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> first, I think she should tell students to <F>um</F> concentrate on the class. And I think she should <F>um</F> make more class interesting by not using only books but maybe try to do worksheets or <F>um</F> ask students questions. <F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. All right. <F>Er</F> you have a <SC>uniform</SC></A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>school uniform</OL>.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>. So what do you think of them?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I think <F>er</F> <SC>it's</SC> I like wearing uniform because it's kind of represent we are from one school and we have like unity <?>in our</?> school. <F>Um</F> and I like how our uniform is not like set completely. Like we don't have to wear certain socks or certain shirts but we get to choose. So I think that's the way, how we show our characteristic in this school.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. O K. Then what kind of school rules do you have?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>.</B>
<A>Regulations.</A>
<B><?>School</?> regulation. <F>Um</F> basically we have to respect other people and <F>er</F> we have to wear uniforms, <F>um</F> and <F>um</F> <F>mm</F> we are not allowed to ride bikes to school.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>We only</OL> have to walk or use trains. And other rules are just like basic</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>urm</F> stuff like we are not allowed to do, like listen to music during class. It doesn't say in our handbook, but it's <F>um</F> kind of we know it, we have to do. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Ah</F> O K. So those rules are O K <OL>for you</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. <F>Um</F> <F>mm</F> <F>well</F> not O K, but <F>um</F> so <SC?>you don't</SC?> <nvs>cough</nvs> <R>they don't tell us</R> they don't tell us we can't do that but we just know it so we don't do it. <F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>

<A><F>Hm</F>. But why did you join the girl scout in the first place?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> because <F>er</F> my friend was in it.
