<B>Yes, sure.</B>
<A>How are you today, <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> pretty good. But <F>err</F> I've been suffering from jet lag still now, because I came back <F>uum</F> to Japan from New York just two days ago, so.</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Sure</OL>. What were you doing in New York?</A>
<B><F>Err</F> I just visited my co-worker and then learned about what they usually do and something like that. Because <F>err</F> in New York branch, they had a big problem, so my co-worker told me not to interrupt and bother them, so <SC>I <laughter>just</laughter></SC> I was just <F>err</F> sitting in chair and then looked around. So actually, I didn't have pretty much time to talk to them and learn about, you know, something useful, so.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> <F>um</F> <F>um</F>. And then come back <OL>now</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><F>Erm</F> you've been away from Japan for a long time?</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Er</F> almost five months.</B>
<A>Almost five months.</A>
<B><CO><OL>Because</OL></CO>.</B>
<A><R>Wh</R> what are you doing now <R>to</R> to make up for that time?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> actually, <F>err</F> <R>I</R> I came back to do same section before.</B>
<A>O K.</A>

<A><CO><OL><R>What</R> what</OL></CO>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uum</F> it's not</OL> difficult for me so. <SC>And</SC> but <F>err</F> my section had already moved out Tokyo headquarters since <F>err</F> <F>uum</F> April first. <F>Uum</F> so it's kind of, you know, messy right now. Because they have to <F>er</F> adjust their system and then their daily works to new circumstances, so I have to help them. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K. <F>Er</F> <R>wha</R> what do you want to do <F>erm</F> except work?</A>

<B><OL><F>Err</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><R>now</R> now</OL> that you're back in Japan?</A>
<B>Actually, <F>uum</F> my boss sent me to San Diego to practice my English because my English was good enough to negotiate with manufacturers and <F>um</F> paper agent. But I learned about <F>er</F> not only English but also, you know, American culture and religions and others, everything. So I'm really interested in American culture and Western culture as well. So I really want to watch American movies as much as I can. And I want to contact with American embassy, some way, I don't know right now, but I want to contact them and then find some American friends to talk in English. Because <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I don't want to, I mean, speak Japanese only, I mean, I want to keep my English very well.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. <R>I see</R> I see. Did you <F>um</F> watch the soccer last night?</A>
<B>Yes. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>What did you think?</A>
<B><F>Uum</F> <R>I'm</R> I'm happy because Japan got one point <R>in</R> in <R>it's</R> it's history, so. And then also, <SC>I'm happy <F>uum</F> to see</SC> I was happy to see Korea won Poland. Because <F>err</F> I have a close friend in Korea. And his name is <?>Goah</?>. <F>Err</F> I met him in San Diego and we are very good friends.

Let me describe this picture at first, <F>err</F> a young girl is sitting in a chair and probably, she is <F>er</F> <F>err</F> about send some e-mails to her friend <SC>because the door</SC> and I think she's also in a hurry because the door is open. <F>Err</F> <R>and</R> <SC>and she</SC> and the cat is <F>er</F> taking a nap on the bed, and also the dog is taking a nap <nvs>laughter</nvs> on the floor. So I guess it's a <SC>nice</SC> really nice day. And the temperature is <F>er</F> kind of high. And she has a <F>err</F> C D player <F>err</F> <SC>in her hou</SC> in her room, <R>and</R> and also, she has a telephone.

<A><OL>Did you have a good</OL> trip?</A>
<B>Yeah. It's kind of good. But <F>err</F> I have to ask you about that trip. Because I heard that trip is, you know, <F>err</F> by your ship.

<A><F>Well</F> I don't know what I can do?</A>
<B>So <SC>I</SC> actually, I was not satisfied with <SC>your</SC> you know, this trip. So I really want to get some reimbursement. So can you do that for me?</B>
<A><F>Well</F> <R>I</R> I'll need to check with the shipping company, but I'll get back to you</A>

<A>Like that. <F>Erm</F> I'd like you to make up a story from these pictures.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>But this happened before.</A>
<B><F>Uhu</F>.</B>
<A>So please start "One day last week," and then begin.</A>
<B><F>Uhu</F>. One day last week, <F>err</F> Taro was <F>err</F> going his office. <F>Er</F> he was a freshman, he just entered the company. And that day was the first time for him to go to his office. So he got up early in the morning. And he arrived at <F>err</F> the station. But <F>err</F> on the platform, <F>err</F> he dropped his <F>err</F> briefcase <F>err</F> on the rail. And <F>err</F> actually, <F>ee</F> <SC>the guy <F>ee</F> who was talking</SC> the old guy who was talking to his co-worker <F>er</F> pushed his hand, that's why he dropped his briefcase. So he put too much blame on the old guy, and he complained <SC>about</SC> a lot about it. And also the train <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>ee</F> <R>came</R> came to the platform and then his luggage <F>uum</F> was <F>err</F> run over <nvs>laughter</nvs> by the train. And then <SC><??></??></SC> but fortunately, <F>err</F> his luggage <F>ee</F> was <F>err</F> safe. <SC>And then</SC> and finally, he asked the station clerk to <SC>pick <F>um</F> his baggage</SC> <F>er</F> pick up his baggage. <SC>And then</SC> but I think <F>ur</F> <SC>it's</SC> it was kind of <F>er</F> problem because he was lack of <F>er</F> sociability because he shouldn't have put such too much claim on the old guy. And <R>that</R> that's why he was late for his opening time.</B>

<A><OL>O K</OL>. For you, <R>what's the</R> what's the absolutely worst part of traveling by train in Japan?</A>
<B><F>Uum</F> worst part?
