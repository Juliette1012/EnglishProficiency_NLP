<stage2>
<task>
<A><F>Urm</F> first thing today, please describe this picture.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> it's a mathematic class. And the teacher is explaining, but only one person <?>is</?> listening.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ur</F> <?>other</?> people are like listening to music, talking and E-mail and like looking out the window.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><.></.></B>
<A><nvs>smack</nvs> O K. O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>You said you liked your <SC>school</SC> international school in Germany better.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> can you compare <OL>your</OL> school in Germany and your school here in <H pn="others2">XXX05</H>?</A>
<B><OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL> <F>Urm</F> first of all, like the seating, <F>um</F> we sit like individually here.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>But in Germany, <SC>it's</SC> we sit as a group like the size of this table. <nvs>cough</nvs> And then like if the teacher asks us questions, <F>ur</F> we can talk to each other and find out the answer. <?>And it was</?> <??></??></B>
<A>But don't you think <SC>this kind of seating is</SC> <F>ur</F> when you want to concentrate, for example,</A>
<B><F>Urm</F>.</B>
<A>the seating is not so good?</A>
<B><SC>Not</SC> <F>uh</F> when we wanted to concentrate, <F>um</F> <.></.> it was O K. Yeah. Because the tests weren't as serious as in this school.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Um</F> it wasn't that hard so just <SC>we s</SC> we did studying at home.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>mhm</F>. So <nvs>cough</nvs> do you mean that it wasn't very important to get good grades at school?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> it was important, but it was actually quite easy to get good grades.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>Because if you just hand in homeworks and just listen to the teachers, you get good grades.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>So <?>more simple</?>.</B>
<A><laughter>I see</laughter>. O K. <F>Well</F> then what do you think was the negative point about the international school?</A>
