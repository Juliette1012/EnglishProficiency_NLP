<stage1>
<A>O K. Let's begin. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. What is your name?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Yes, please. Or just call me <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. <OL><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>Yes</R></OL> yes.</B>
<A><F>Huh</F>. O K. How are you today, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Yes, fine. But a little bit nervous. <nvs>laughter</nvs> You can understand, I think.</B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Yeah. And, O K. <F>Er</F> it's Friday today, but what do you usually do on Fridays?</A>
<B>On Friday, I am a housewife with two boys. And I <F>er</F> usually <F>er</F> do my <F>er</F> house <F>er</F> stuffs. And then, <F>er</F> if I have some job, I'm working as a part-time <F>er</F> interpreter and <F>er</F> part-time guide for foreign tourists. So, if I get some job, of course I would do some job, but <F>er</F> usually I would stay at home.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> I <OL>see</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>. Yeah.</B>
<A>Sounds interesting.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> <F>urm</F> why did you <F>er</F> start <.></.> doing that job?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> I was interested in <F>er</F> communicating with people. And I like to meet people and I'd like to help people. And especially tour guide job <SC>encourages me to do more and</SC> <F>er</F> encourages me to study <F>er</F> more about Japan. And I'd like to introduce Japan more. So, it's very <F>er</F> fruitful job for me.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Did you have any problem in that job?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> yes. Of course. Every time. <SC>It's</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>I think it's</SC> I call this job <F>er</F> <F>er</F> accidental or I don't know what to call it, <SC>it's a</SC> <F>erm</F> it is <F>er</F> always <F>er</F> <F>er</F> very <F>er</F> exciting but <F>er</F> sometimes <F>er</F> very exhausting, too. <F>Er</F> because <F>er</F> <SC>there wer</SC> there are not <F>er</F> only my fault but also <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> like <F>er</F> <F>er</F> weather condition or the condition of the traffic. And, of course, the combination of the tour group. Sometimes <laughter>they are not</laughter> very kind and sometimes they can be mean. But <F>er</F> <SC>I wou</SC> I do my best to have a <.></.> better and more comfortable <F>er</F> atmosphere for them, so. So, <SC>by the time of the day</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>by the</R> <R>by the en</R> by the end of the day, I would be pretty exhausted, but I'm very <F>er</F> <.></.> satisfied. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mm-huh</F></OL>. I see.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. And <F>er</F> you said you have two boys. And are you a strict mother?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> yes. <R>I</R> I <F>er</F> should admit, I <.></.> think <F>er</F> <.></.> I should not stay with them for such a long time. If I keep an eye on them, I start to <.></.> <F>er</F> criticize. <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I'd like to give more advice to them and <SC>I don't think it's <F>er</F> good</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>uh</F> I don't think <R>it</R> it isn't <F>erm</F> good <F>er</F> relationship between us. So, I think I should stay maybe a little bit far from them, and see them from outside occasionally. If I too close to them, it's not <?>pretty</?> good.</B>
<A><F>Mm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Then, <F>erm</F> <.></.> at weekend, what do you do?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> over weekend. <F>Erm</F> of course, sometimes over weekend, <F>er</F> I get some jobs because <R>it's</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> it's very <F>erm</F> <.></.> sometimes busy. <F>Erm</F> because tour <R>o</R> <SC>o</SC> <F>er</F> very busy over weekends, so. But <F>erm</F> usually <R>I would s</R> I would stay at home and I take my boys to soccer field and I can be a soccer mom for them. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL>Yes</OL>.</B>

<B>Yeah. <F>Erm</F>. Can I just start?</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Erm</F> this is <F>er</F> <F>erm</F> I think suburb of the <F>er</F> some big town. And <F>er</F> it is a sunny, <F>er</F> <.></.> warm day. And <R>it</R> it's probably autumn or <F>er</F> spring. The temperature is not very high, <SC>so that</SC> so, <R>I cou</R> I could see a <SC>wha</SC> <F>er</F> person <F>er</F> jogging and another old <F>er</F> man <SC>are si</SC> is sitting <F>er</F> on the beach reading a newspaper. And <F>er</F> there are housewives talking or chatting over something. And <F>er</F> a girl <.></.> <SC>is <F>er</F> <.></.> jumping rope</SC> <SC>is doing ju</SC> <F>er</F> is jumping rope. And <F>er</F> <R>a</R> <SC>a</SC> there are two boys <F>er</F> <.></.> playing with a ball. <R>And</R> <.></.> and I think it's a very peaceful <OL><F>er</F> picture, yeah</OL>.</B>

<B><F>Ah</F> I think it's, <F>er</F> in a way, similar to my house area. Yes.</B>
<A>O K. Then, what's the difference?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> the difference. <F>Er</F> <F>er</F> there are several houses but <F>er</F> in my area, there are more <R>apartment</R> <R>apartment</R> <F>er</F> apartment or <F>er</F> condominiums. <SC>So</SC> and it's more <laughter>spacious</laughter> <R>tha</R> than our place, I think. <OL>Yeah</OL>.</B>

And <.></.> <F>ur</F> they checked what they were <SC>going to get</SC> going to bring <.></.> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> some stuffs and <F>er</F> they were ready. And when they arrived, the weather was <F>er</F> wonderful, so, they were having <SC>ha</SC> very good time. At first, they had to, of course, <F>er</F> <R>ma</R> make a tent and <F>er</F> <SC>they are</SC> they were preparing for the meals. And <SC>they are</SC> <F>erm</F> <SC>they had a</SC> <R>they ha</R> they had a good time over there. But all of a sudden, the rain started. <SC>And</SC> <F>er</F> of course, they didn't expect. But they were very clever. <F>ur</F> <SC>Before the <F>er</F> what</SC> before the storm <.></.> would have come, they were ready <F>er</F> <.></.> to leave. And actually their decision was right. <F>Er</F>. As soon as they <F>er</F> left over there, <F>er</F> without <F>er</F> <F>er</F> cleaning up <SC>the</SC> their <F>er</F> stuffs, actually the storm came and the rain and the wind were getting worse.

And <SC>I</SC> as a guide, I went to Mount Fuji so many times. And <F>er</F> people ask me about <R>how was</R> <F>er</F> <SC>how was</SC> how is the temperature or how is the <F>erm</F> atmosphere over there, but I couldn't answer them correctly.
