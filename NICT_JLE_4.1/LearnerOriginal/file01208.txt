<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><R>But</R></OL> but generally, I don't like pink or those <laughter>kind of</laughter> bright colors. So it doesn't match my style at all. It doesn't match my other <OL>clothes</OL>.</B>

<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><laughter>in real life, I think</laughter>.</B>
<A>So you have to make a really good decision. But <F>ur</F> when you buy, for example, a skirt, how do you decide which skirt to buy?</A>
<B><F>Uhh</F> <R>I</R> <.></.> I think about other <R>clothes</R> clothes I have at home, and I'll think if the skirt matches my clothing, my style. <R>And yeah</R> and yeah, that's <SC>I</SC> what I think</B>
