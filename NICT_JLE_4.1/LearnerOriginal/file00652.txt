<A>May I have your name, please?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>.</B>
<A><H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>Yes. O K. <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> Tomorrow is Saturday. What do you usually do on Saturdays?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> on Saturdays, <SC>I usually</SC> <.></.> I either stay home or teach <F>er</F> as a tutor. I teach a <F>erm</F> twelve-year old boy. He's now preparing for <.></.> the entrance examination for the <F>er</F> <.></.> you know, the private junior high schools.</B>
<A><.></.> <F>Hm</F>. Can you tell me more about him?</A>
<B>About him?</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Erm</F></OL>. <F>Well</F> <.></.> actually, <F>er</F> I started teaching him <F>er</F> this October. Because he needs special training in the subject of <F>er</F> social study.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Because he is now thinking of <F>er</F> <.></.> <nvs>snap</nvs> <SC>taking an examination</SC> taking an entrance examination to <H pn="school name1">XXX02</H> junior <.></.> <F>er</F> high school. And <F>er</F> that school <SC>sort of gives a very special</SC> sort of strange <F>er</F> test on social science. So <R>I</R> I <F>er</F> sort of have to help him <F>er</F> have a sort of, you know, answer-questions or stuff like that.</B>
<A><.></.> Can you tell me what you mean by "strange"?</A>
<B>Strange? I mean <F>er</F> <.></.> usually, <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>eh</F> <R>you kno</R> you know, the test of social study for, you know, <F>erm</F> elementary school children or kids <F>erm</F>,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>snap</nvs> <.></.> <SC><?>so ranges</?>, you know, from, let's say, geography, history to</SC> <.></.> <SC>it is</SC> <R>a</R> anyway, covers a whole range of social study that <.></.> most children learn in elementary school. But <H pn="school name1">XXX02</H> <F>er</F> junior high school <F>er</F> sort of <.></.> focuses on one topic <.></.> each year. <.></.> And for each year, the topic is different. And so you need to be very <F>erm</F> <.></.> familiar with some topics that <.></.> the you know, <R>the</R> <F>uh</F> <R>the</R> the kind of topics that are <.></.> talked about and the news or <.></.> <R>tha</R> that sort of <F>er</F> timely topic. I don't know how to say that in <OL>English exactly</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Hm</F>. I see. O K. So what do you do for fun?</A>
<B><.></.> <R>You</R> you mean on Saturdays <OL>or</OL>,</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. In general.</A>
<B>for holiday? In general? <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> <SC>Very ofte</SC> <F>er</F> very sometimes I play tennis <F>er</F> <SC>with my family</SC> with my younger brother. Very sometimes. And <.></.> what else? I listen to music. <F>Er</F>. Recently, I'm very <F>erm</F> fond of listening to the music by the Back Street Boys. Do you know them?</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. A little bit. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A>What's so good about them?</A>
<B><.></.> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>It's hard to explain that. That <F>er</F> <F>well</F> <.></.> <R>their</R> their music <SC>has a sort of</SC> <F>er</F> <.></.> has a kind of the <R>ballad taste to it</R> ballad taste to it. And I like the part. And <F>er</F> I've heard their music <.></.> <F>er</F> often on T V of <SC>on s</SC> you know, <F>eh</F> on T V commercials. So sort of <SC>the</SC> their sounds are kind of familiar to me. And that's why I <F>erm</F> came to listen <.></.> to their music.</B>
<A><.></.> I see. <F>Erm</F> O K. So do you go to their concerts sometimes?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> No. <R>I</R> <R>I'm</R> <SC>I'm</SC> actually, I just started listening to their music <OL>now</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh</F></OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>Before that, <SC>I was</SC> <F>er</F> basically, I like Carpenters' songs.</B>

<A><OL>And please describe it</OL>. <.></.> Anyway you want.</A>
<B><.></.> O K. <.></.> All right. <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> A woman is sitting in a chair and <.></.> holding out one of her hands toward the computer screen. And in the room, there are two animals. One is a dog and the other one, which is on the bed, is a cat. And also, <.></.> there is a calendar on the wall. And <??></??> it seems that it is June. And there is also a clock on the wall. And it's <F>erm</F> seems nine o'clock, I guess. And the door is open. And <SC>there's a big</SC> <F>er</F> how do you say that, <F>er</F> <SC>there's <SC>a big</SC> <.></.> two stereos or</SC> <.></.> I mean, no, <SC>there are two</SC> excuse me, there is a big stereo behind the calendar. <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> There is also a dust box <F>er</F> beside the chair.</B>
<A><.></.> O K.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>All right.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Is your room as organized as this one?</A>
<B><.></.> <nvs>sigh</nvs> My room is not organized at all. It's totally messy. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>So <R>it's</R> <R>it's</R> it's a kind of model that I have to follow.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. <.></.> <SC>How</SC> <R>wha</R> what do you need to do to be organized <.></.> like this?</A>
<B>To organize my room?</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Well</F> first, I have to <.></.> buy another bookshelf to put my books in. 'Cause my floor is filled with a lot of books and <SC>just</SC> <.></.> sometimes I get <F>er</F> lost which book is where. <CO><laughter>So</laughter></CO>. It doesn't mean I'm bookish person. <F>Eh</F>. I'm writing a thesis now, so I'm being a bookish.</B>

<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>? And <F>um</F> what are some difficulties with that?</A>
<B>The first problem <.></.> with my topic, <R>I'm</R> I'm writing a thesis on the <F>er</F> relationship between <.></.> the comprehension of standard accent and comprehension on non-standard accent. And that field <?>has</?> not been explored enough <.></.> by <F>er</F> researchers yet. So it's kind of hard for me to find some <.></.> relevant <F>er</F> the past researches or the, you know, past studies in the book. So that is <R>the</R> <.></.> the primary <F>er</F> difficulty I <.></.> am faced with.</B>
