<A><R>Wh</R> why does it happen?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> Because I can't finish packing. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So I have to stay all night. But I can't stay all night, and I go to bed, and I find myself oversleep so. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> O K.</A>
</followup>
</stage3>
<stage4>
<task>
<A>All right. So lastly, there's another picture.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is taking out the picture.</ctxt>
<A>O K. This is a sequence of pictures. There're six pictures from one to six. And please make up a story based on these pictures. And this happened before. So please start your story with "One day last week".</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures.</ctxt>
<B><F>Ur</F>. One day last week, me and my friends <R>were</R> were planning to go camping to Nagano. And <R>we</R> we did a camp by the river side. But in the afternoon, it stopped raining heavily. <SC>We</SC> and we have to go inside a car. And while we were planning to go home, we found a hotel. So we stayed there <R>for a</R> for a night.</B>
<A>O K. All right.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Have you been camping?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. Tell the last time you went camping.</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. Three years ago, <R>I went</R> <F>ur</F> I went mountaineering to <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> in mountain in Matsumoto, yeah, with my friend.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. Tell me what you did.</A>
<B><F>Uhh</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Oh</F> I just <R>climbing</R> <SC>climbing</SC> climbed. <CO>And</CO>. <F>Um</F>. What did I do? Because it was my first time mountaineering. So <R>I bought</R> <F>ur</F> I bought everything such as tent and shoes and trousers for mountaineering the day before. And I slept in front of <SC>the station</SC> Matsumoto Station at night with my sleeping bag. And yeah, I took <SC>a train</SC> the first train to the <SC>mount</SC> <F>ur</F> station near the mountain. And I climbed that mountain.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. So what do you think is the good point of such kind of mountaineering rather than staying in a hotel?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. <SC><R>It is</R> it is good because we don't have to pay attention to <F>um</F> <??></??></SC> it's good because <R>we</R> we can stay anywhere <SC>if</SC> as far as we have a sleeping bag. So that's the good point. But the bad point is that we have to carry the sleeping bag and tent. So it's quite heavy. So it makes us very tired. So that's the bad point I think.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. You are so tiny. Is there any secret to carry all those stuff?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F>. <F>Mm-mm</F>. <.></.> Any secret, <R>I</R> I don't think so. <R>Just</R> just try to <laughter>carry</laughter>.</B>

<A><F>Mhm</F>. When is the due?</A>
<B>Tomorrow. Tomorrow <SC>at</SC> by two o'clock.</B>
<A><F>Uh-hm</F>.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Wow</F>. So you can't sleep tonight?</A>
<B><F>Urr</F> I hope I can. But <nvs>laughter</nvs> I'm afraid not.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Wow</F>. So when are you moving out?</A>
<B><F>Urmm</F>. At the beginning of next month, on December first.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. Near the campus?</A>
<B>Yeah. And <SC>my</SC> one of my friend will help me to carry my owned stuff to my new place by car. So yeah.</B>
