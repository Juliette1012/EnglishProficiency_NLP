<B><OL><?>Thank you</?></OL>.</B>
<A>O K? Whenever you're ready.</A>
<B>Yes. <F>Um</F> <R>I</R> I guess this is a classroom in high school. And a female teacher is explaining charts or something on that board. Maybe this is the math class. And the students are not really concentrating on the class. <F>Er</F> only one students <F>uh</F> sitting <SC>in</SC> just in front of the teacher is learning very seriously but <SC>the other</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>next student, <F>er</F> he is</SC> <F>er</F> the boy next to the serious guy is like <SC>watching</SC> looking <SC>at the</SC> <F>ur</F> out the window. And the girl next to him is sending E-mails on the cellphone. And two girls are <F>well</F> maybe talking about fashion or something. And <F>er</F> one guy is listening to music and drinking something even in the class.</B>

<A>O K, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, can you tell me some of the differences you realized <F>um</F> between your daughter's classes and your high school days or junior high school days?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> my daughter now goes to a private school so she wears like a school uniform everyday. So <F>oh</F> O K. When I was a junior high school student, I went to public a school but I had a school uniform. And <F>er</F> <F>oh</F> <F>well</F> my daughter is interested in fashion now, so she buys lot of fashion magazines</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>every week.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But I was not interested in fashion at all. I was just playing tennis everyday.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>. And <??></??> <F>er</F> differences <R>in</R> in the classroom?</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> I don't know exactly what's going on in her class because I don't have any chances to go to her class and observe the class. So <R>I</R> I can't tell. But according to her story, everybody is studying seriously but sometimes she falls off asleep, <R>she</R> <R>she</R> she says to me. Because the school is far from my house. So maybe it's a lot of work for her to take a bus and train to go to school. And <F>well</F> that's it.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. I see. O K. <F>Um</F> do you think it's important to keep track of your daughter's life?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> <F>well</F> until high school, I guess, <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I think so. <OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>O K</OL>. Why until high school?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <SC>after that</SC> <F>well</F> maybe until twenty years old, <F>um</F> I guess it's <F>er</F> our responsibility to take a look <SC>a her</SC> at her life and <F>um</F> <R>I need to</R> I need to support her <OL>as much as possible</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F> <F>mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>And if she goes out with <R>some</R> someone bad,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and <R>if she star</R> if she starts to go out with someone bad to Shibuya or Shinjuku, <F>well</F> maybe we can <F>er</F> discipline her <F>um</F> with the problem by looking at her appearance.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Like <F>er</F></OL> her makeup or</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>fashion</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>or something. I need to check that.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. I see. O K. O K. Thank you, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</A>
