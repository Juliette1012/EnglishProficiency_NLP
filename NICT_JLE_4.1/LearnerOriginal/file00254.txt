<A>So, what would you like us to do <.></.> for you now?</A>

<B><laughter>Honeymoon trip</laughter>. O K. <SC>By m</SC> <F>er</F> about myself? <nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. <F>Er</F>. We went to Hawaii. <F>Um</F> <F>er</F> Oahu and Maui Island.</B>
<A><F>Uhmm</F>.</A>
<B><.></.> Yeah.</B>
<A>What did you like best about that trip?</A>
<B><F>Umm</F>. Since I visited Oahu Island before <F>erm</F> <.></.> with my family. <SC>So</SC> <R>and</R> <.></.> and Maui was my first time to visit. So, Maui was the most impressive place to me.</B>
<A><F>Huh</F>. In what way?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <.></.> <SC>unlike Oahu</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <SC>like</SC> unlike busy street <.></.> like <F>er</F> <SC>Kaua</SC> Waikiki Street in Oahu, <F>erm</F> Maui is <F>er</F> very <.></.> quiet <.></.> and <.></.> much more nature. So, <F>um</F> that is <F>er</F> <.></.> thing I liked.</B>

<B>O K. One day last week, <F>erm</F> I went to the department store.

And I paid <.></.> <SC>the</SC> that fee to the clerk and <nvs>laughter</nvs> I was <.></.> on my way to go out from the department store. But at that time, <R>I</R> <.></.> <R>I</R> <.></.> I saw some <.></.> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <R>final sale</R> <.></.> <F>er</F> final sale <F>umm</F> poster <.></.> at the <R>shoe st</R> shoe store. And <F>oh</F> <F>oh</F> <F>oh</F> <R>I must</R> I must <laughter>buy some</laughter> nice shoes for me, too. <SC>And</SC> but <.></.> <R>nex</R> <R>nex</R> <.></.> next moment, <F>erm</F> I found <R>much more</R> <.></.> <F>umm</F> <R>much more better</R> <SC>much more</SC> better attention. That says fifty percent off. So, <SC>I went into the</SC> <.></.> I went into that clothes store and I chose one blouse for me and I bought it. <R>And</R> <.></.> <R>and</R> <.></.> <F>oh</F> and also <F>umm</F> some nice <JP>one piece</JP>. And <.></.> finally, I went out of the store <SC>with my</SC> with this many <.></.> paper bags <R>filled with</R> <.></.> filled with <F>erm</F> lots of items.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. O K. Thank you, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Can you compare a big department store with a small <SC>convenient</SC> convenience store?</A>
<B><CO>Store like a <R>Fa</R> Family <R>Mar</R> Mart or</CO>. O K. <F>Well</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> one <.></.> big difference is, <F>er</F> <.></.> the time they open is so different. <F>Erm</F> department stores usually <SC>st</SC> open at ten a.m. in the morning and <F>erm</F> usually <SC>finish</SC> they close at <F>er</F> eight or nine <.></.> <F>er</F> in the evening. But on the other hand <F>er</F> in the small convenient store <R>o</R> <SC>open</SC> sometimes open twenty-four hours. And so, <R>it's</R> it's more convenient <R>for</R> for customers. <F>Hmm</F>. But on the other hand, department store <F>em</F> have a <R>va</R> variety of goods <F>er</F> from <.></.> food to <F>er</F> clothes. <.></.> <R>On</R> on the other hand, <F>er</F> <F>em</F> small convenient store doesn't <SC>ha</SC> sell <.></.> clothes or <F>um</F> lots of other items that department store sell.</B>
