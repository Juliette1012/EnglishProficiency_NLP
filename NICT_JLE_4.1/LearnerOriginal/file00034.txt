<stage1>
<A>My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have your name, please?</A>
<B><F>Ahh</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>O K. Can I call you <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>O K. So <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, how are you today?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> good. But <?>a bit</?> sleepy.</B>
<A><laughter>Sleepy</laughter>?</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Why</OL>?</A>
<B>I don't know. <F>Ah</F> I think I had enough sleeping time, but I don't think it's good time <F>ah</F> to get up.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> I see. All right. So <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, <F>ah</F> can you tell me about yourself?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> O K. So I'm <F>um</F> junior <H pn="school name1">XXX03</H> <F>um</F> commercial department, and now <F>umm</F> I'm major in <F>umm</F> <F>umm</F> manager accounting. So, I will study it in detail from next year. And now I am joining the club of amateur radio. It's in science division.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>So I've been <F>um</F> enjoying amateur radio club <F>mm</F> when I was junior high school.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. So a long history. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. Kind of.</B>
<A>I see. So <R>I</R> I am not familiar with this amateur <OL>radio club</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</B>
<A>Can you describe it for me?</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F> O K. <F>Um</F> of course, it's a club of amateur radio, and <.></.> <F>umm</F> to enjoy amateur radio, we need to get license <F>um</F> because <F>um</F> we use public <F>um</F> radio wave, and after you get the license of amateur radio, you can enjoy, and <F>mm</F> at first you need <F>uh</F> antenna and <F>nn</F> transceiver, <.></.> and yeah. I think <R>that's</R> that's it. <OL><CO>And</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. So what made you become interested in this?</A>
<B><F>Umm</F> O K. <F>Um</F> I think so one interest is <.></.> to speak to other people, and <SC>the</SC> <.></.> <F>nn</F> another interest is <F>umm</F> <R>ex</R> experiment. So, we can make <F>mm</F> antenna or transceiver <F>n</F> by ourselves, so unlike telephones we can use our own stuff. So, it's our major interest.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Hum</F>. Sounds very interesting but difficult <laughter>maybe</laughter>.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> but it's just a hobby so.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>We don't have to study so much.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. I see. All right. Very good. <F>Ah</F> <R><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H></R> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, where do you live?</A>
<B><F>Umm</F> I live in <H pn="others1">XXX04</H>.</B>
<A><F>Aa</F>. <F>Ah</F> were you born there?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> no. So actually, I was born in <H pn="others2">XXX05</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And I moved to <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> when <F>umm</F> I was in kindergarten.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. So, how do you like <H pn="others1">XXX04</H>?</A>
<B>So I think that <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> is a best town so far.</B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B>So <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> is of course <F>um</F> city but <F>um</F> not so big <F>um</F> like <F>um</F> <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> or <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>. So we also have nature like <H pn="others5">XXX08</H> park. So in <H pn="others1">XXX04</H>, we have <F>um</F> cities, <F>n</F> so many shops and also nature. So <R>it's a</R> it's a good point of <H pn="others1">XXX04</H>.</B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>I see. <F>Hum</F> all right, thank you very much. Now let's move onto the next stage. <F>Ah</F>.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is choosing a picture.</ctxt>
<A>I want you to look at this picture</A>
<B><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</B>
<A>And describe it for me.</A>
<B>O K. So I think there it's a scene of the party. So maybe dinner. And there are <F>umm</F> three couples <F>uh</F> enjoying dinner. And one lady is playing the piano. So I think it's classic. And the <R>boy</R> <F>uh</F> boy brought the <.></.> champagne or wine. <F>Ah</F> I guess it's a Beaujolais Nouveau, <laughter>maybe</laughter>. Yeah, and <.></.> let's see. <.></.> <F>Ahm</F> one couple <F>uh</F> don't begin to eat yet. Maybe, so they are just <F>mm</F> enjoying their <F>er</F> first wine. So probably, <F>ah</F> they'll start to eat after drinking. <F>Uh</F> let's see. So, but <F>umm</F> nobody <F>nn</F> is dancing, so maybe <F>um</F> this party is held in Japan.</B>
<A>O K. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>.</B>
<A>Very good observation.</A>
<B>Thank you.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>Do you like to party?</A>
<B>Yeah, <OL>I like</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Yes</OL>? <F>Ahh</F> so, can you describe how different your party is from this party?</A>
<B>So <F>umm</F> I like American style party. <CO><R>So</R> so I like dancing <.></.> or music or</CO>.</B>
<A>I see. So <F>uh</F> have you ever lived in the United States?</A>
<B>So I have stayed in the States for one year. So at that time, I joined many party.</B>
<A>I see. So, <F>uh</F> what did you find most <F>ah</F> different from Japanese <F>um</F> culture?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>um</F>. You mean, O K. So I think the big difference between Japanese and American culture is <F>umm</F> <.></.> <F>um</F> whether you can do <F>umm</F> <F>ah</F> what you like or not. So in Japan, <F>ah</F> when you <F>a</F> play your own interest <SC>so much because</SC> <F>um</F> <F>ah</F> no so much, maybe so other people don't like you because so there is no <F>mm</F> topic to speak or something. So we sometimes call <F>um</F> such people <JP>otaku</JP>, and I don't think so. It's not word to respect, <F>uh</F> although <SC>they are</SC> they specialize in <F>ah</F> some hobby or interest. <CO>But in the States, we can <.></.> do our own interest, our own hobby, so without <F>um</F> <.></.> <F>umm</F> you know</CO>. O K. <F>Umm</F> I think in the States as long as <F>umm</F> <F>uh</F> we don't prevent <F>um</F> other's hobby or profit in the States, we can do anything. So, I think it's a big difference.</B>
<A>O K. Yes, that's a good point. <F>Um</F>. All right, thank you.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
</followup>
</stage2>

<A>Really.</A>
<B><R>So</R> so we can find them in soap or towel, the front of <F>mm</F> refrigerator, the pillow.</B>

So as a result, so his bike <F>umm</F> broke. So of course, <F>umm</F> he got angry so much, but I also got angry so because so my cart <SC>are broken</SC> were broken, too. So <F>ah</F> we <F>mmm</F> we quarreled so much. But <F>um</F> we realized we couldn't <F>uh</F> solve the problem. So finally, <F>um</F> we called the <F>uh</F> police. Then, <F>ah</F> we talked a lot. <F>Umm</F> so but <F>uum</F> we didn't find the result, <SC>so because</SC> so police said so <.></.> he would tell us the result later.

So we called to the <F>ah</F> repair center. And he came here. So it took one hour, so we waited so much. And as a result, <F>ah</F> <R>he</R> <F>umm</F> he said good bye to his bike, and <.></.> but <R>I can't</R> <F>mmm</F> I can't leave him alone, so I felt <F>uh</F> sorry a little, so <.></.> I allowed him to <F>uh</F> get on board <F>uh</F> to my car. So <F>ah</F> we had <R>a</R> <F>uh</F> a terrible accident, but after that, we enjoyed <F>uh</F> the drive together. So <F>uh</F> since this accident, <F>ah</F> we had been a good friend.</B>
