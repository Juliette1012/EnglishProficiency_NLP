<B><F>Well</F> <R>a</R> actually, <F>er</F> <SC>in</SC> <F>er</F> from Monday to Friday, I have a work. So I almost have little time to spend for me. <CO>But <F>er</F> after work, <F>er</F> I often go to drinking some</CO>. <F>Er</F>.</B>

<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>You know, <F>er</F> O K, I like a Australia or California wine</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>which is <SC>very</SC> <F>er</F> a little bit <F>er</F> different from French or Italian one.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I think it's <SC>more</SC> very <F>er</F> <JP>nandaro</JP> <F>er</F> thick or dense. Very <F>er</F> heavy and <F>er</F> fruity. So I like red wine. But <F>er</F> <SC>I think</SC> <F>er</F> there are <F>er</F> <SC>not a mu</SC> not a many restaurant who had Australian wine,</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>

<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>Very <F>er</F> <R>ki</R> <JP>nandaro</JP> kind of cartoon, I guess. And <F>er</F> in front of the house, <F>er</F> <.></.> three childrens are playing.

<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>kind of <F>er</F> exercise. And the two dogs also are facing each other in front of the house. On the road, <F>er</F> I can see a white car, and <F>er</F> over <laughter>the</laughter> top of the car,</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>.</A>
<B>is it cat or dog? But some animal is sleeping.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>

<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> <SC>I can see some</SC> <F>ah</F> there is a man. <nvs>laughter</nvs> He is most active in this picture. He is <F>er</F> wearing blue and <F>er</F> running.

<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL>Tone River</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B>Some river. And <F>er</F> also, we just brought a camp. So we decided to stay overnight there. Because it's very warm day. And <SC>the sun</SC> very fresh air. So my sister was in girl scout. So she said she could do it. <SC>She <??></??></SC> and <F>er</F> actually, she was very <F>er</F> good at building a tent. But too suddenly, <F>er</F> we had a rain. I thought it was a little bit <F>er</F> just <F>erm</F> <SC>s</SC> <F>er</F> not so strong rain or heavy rain. So we said "O K. We can stay here.". But <laughter>suddenly</laughter>, it was a storm or typhoon. And <F>em</F> all the stuffs are just crushed and <F>er</F> just blown away. So we just <F>er</F> went into the car. And <F>er</F> escaped from the river. And <F>er</F> <F>wow</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> to make it worse, <F>er</F> there was a thunder. So we couldn't go back to <SC>the</SC> our house. Because <F>er</F> there was some accident on the road. And <F>er</F> we couldn't go any further. But <F>er</F> very fortunately, we have just found us a <R>so</R> some hotel, Hotel Cosmos. And <F>er</F> very luckily, <F>er</F> we had a vacant room. And <F>er</F> lastly, <F>er</F> we could have a very <F>er</F> nice <F>er</F> black coffee. And in the very safe room.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
