<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>

<B><F>Mm</F> yeah.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Ur</F>.</A>

<A><F>ur</F> is he strict <OL><??></??> strict</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><R>About manner</R></OL> about manner. He was very strict to the manner. Like the way you hold your <SC>s</SC> chopsticks.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>The way you eat. And that kind of stuff.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see. <SC>Do you</SC> does he often tell you how to behave</A>
<B><CO>He <OL>doesn't</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>or</OL> your manners?</A>

<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So he fixed that.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And he tells me to behave myself on trains.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And that kind of things.</B>
<A>What do you feel when he tells you something like that <OL>about manners</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>I think</OL> I think that it's a good thing that someone tells me.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B><?>Or else</?>, probably not very good during the <OL>trains and stuff</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F> but</OL> maybe sometimes you <?>can</?> feel some big differences between your generation <OL>and their <??></??></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Ur</F> I feel that</OL>. But I just take it as, "<F>Oh</F> he's in a different generation.".</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><?>This</?> or people who thinks different ways.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And I accept his opinions.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see. I see. O K.</A>
<B><nvs>cough</nvs></B>
<A>Then <F>ur</F> what kind of club activities do you do in this school?</A>
<B>At this school, I join the dance club.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. I see.</A>
<B><OL><F>Mm-hm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Tell me</OL> more about how do you practice dance in that dance club?</A>
<B><R>We</R> <F>uh</F> we dance about three or four times a week</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>including a Saturday.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And <SC>we dance</SC> we have two performances. One during our festival,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>our <JP><H pn="others3">XXX05</H></JP> festival. And one we just had in February.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <R>we</R> we make up our dance that we dance,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>we think about the program from the beginning like this opening and the finale. <R>And we</R> and we <SC>di</SC> get divided into groups, little groups, big groups. And we make our dances among that. And dance.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Mm-hm</F>. I see. Who <F>ur</F> arranged all these things?</A>
<B>Mostly the second years.</B>
<A><F>Mh-mm</F>.</A>
<B>I'm in the second year right now. <OL><CO>And</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. O K, so what kind of responsibilities did you have for this particular performance in February?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> he had to do everything. We had to <F>urm</F> the practice menu. Like <?>during</?> this time and this time, we would do this. We had to think about that which is like what would be a good way to practice.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>And yeah.</B>
<A>What kind of things can you learn through these practices, not only dancing but to organize <F>ur</F> performance, that sort of thing?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> since I've joined the dance club, <R>I've</R> I've felt a lot of <SC>so</SC> responsibility than before. And that's a good thing that I learned from dance club. <F>Urm</F> also to concentrate when you're practicing. When you don't have a <SC>mu</SC> enough time, you have to concentrate during the certain amount of times. So you have to concentrate and to cooperate with other people.</B>
<A>That's right.</A>
<B>Yeah. <OL><CO>That's</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><?>Yeah, that's something</?></OL>. O K. Thank you.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>Now, I'm going to show you a picture.</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A>I want you to describe the picture. O K. You're student so will you describe this picture in as much detail as possible?</A>
<B><nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>Well</F> this is a picture of a class. And a teacher is trying to teach mathematics, I think. But only like one student is listening to the teacher and studying. Other students are playing with their mobiles, sleeping, talking, drinking. And doesn't have much respect to the teacher. And yes.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. Anything more?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> it looks like a pretty free school.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>They don't have uniforms.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. So will you compare the students here in this picture to your classmates in this school?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> I think it's pretty similar.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> It depends on which classes, but a lot of classes are quite, not many people talk, but people sleep. They do other things like write <F>urm</F> letters, they play with their mobiles. <F>Mm</F>. It's pretty similar.</B>
<A>But as you have already mentioned that they don't wear uniforms,</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A>what do you think of <F>ur</F> uniforms?</A>
<B>I think uniform is <F>ur</F> important <R>thi</R> thing to the school because it <R>makes you f</R> <F>er</F> <F>urm</F> <SC>makes you feel more</SC> what's it called, <F>urm</F> <SC>more</SC> <.></.> makes me feel that I have to study. It makes me feel a part of this school like representative. <nvs>sniff</nvs> It <SC>makes me <R>ha</R> <F>urm</F> <SC>ha</SC> study</SC> <R>makes m</R> makes my will to study <F>um</F> bigger. And <R>I</R> <F>ur</F> I feel like I'm student to this school so it probably helps me with my studying.</B>
<A>Sure. <F>Ahh</F>. <F>Ur</F> <SC>do y</SC> does this school have any particular rules for students' discipline?</A>
<B><F>Well</F> from the picture, it doesn't look like it has any rules.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>.</B>
<A>O K. In your <SC>math cla</SC> <R>math</R> mathematics class, how do your friends <SC>and your</SC> including yourself behave?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> I don't take mathematics anymore, but <SC>in <OL>my first</OL> grade</SC></B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F> I see</OL>.</A>
<B>when I was in the first grade, <SC>it was quite</SC> <?>in</?> math is like, you get little sheets</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and the teacher tells you to solve that. And <R>we solve it</R> <F>um</F> we solve it <?>during</?> our pace.</B>
<A>Sure.</A>
<B>Yeah. So when we don't understand, we call the teachers.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And we solve it as we talk with our friends. So it was <SC>pretty</SC> maybe quite <SC>loud</SC> <OL><F>ur</F> noisy</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I see</OL>. Do you have any suggestions for this particular young teacher to improve the attitudes of the students here?</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>. <.></.> Even during the class is noisy and playing with their mobiles, <SC>she</SC> <F>uh</F> it doesn't seem that she's gonna <F>urm</F> tell them offer or anything.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So maybe she should tell them to behave themselves. And maybe <F>mm</F> <SC>take the class <R>more</R> more fun</SC></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>teach math more fun.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>sniff</nvs></B>
<A>In what way,</A>
<B><nvs>cough</nvs></B>
<A>could it be funnier? <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Well</F> not funny, more interested in.</A>
<B>Interesting. <CO><F>Urm</F> maybe work sheets are a little</CO>.</B>
<A>As you <OL>said</OL> in your mathematics class.</A>
<B><OL>Yeah</OL>. Because just <R>li</R> listening and watching doesn't make you learn. You have to do it yourself.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>sniff</nvs></B>
<A>O K. Thank you.</A>
