<A><F>Oh</F> O K.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>So before you started working here, where did you work?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> that's <R><F>er</F></R> "<??></??> Software". It was <F>er</F> located in <F>er</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, <SC><H pn="others2">XXX04</H></SC> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, and I was there and you know, a company merge happened and we were acquired. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> Alright, so Miss. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, where do you live?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I live in <SC><H pn="others4">XXX06</H></SC> <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>, <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>.</B>
<A>How long have you been living in there?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. Let's see, I've never counted. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <.></.> I guess fifteen <.></.> years. <F>Uh-huh</F></B>
<A>Do you live there with your family?</A>
<B>No, I'm alone.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> O K. So where are you originally from?</A>
<B><H pn="others6">XXX08</H> Prefecture.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>er</F> could you tell me about <H pn="others6">XXX08</H>?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F> <SC>it</SC> <F>oh</F> we had a great deal of snow in the wintertime and <F>er</F> I enjoy the snow but <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I was not good at skiing or skating or anything like that <nvs>laughter</nvs>.</B>
<A>So how do you enjoy snow?</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F> <R>I</R> I love <F>er</F> the scene, you know, black and white, it's so romantic.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K, so what are the bad points about having a lot of snow?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> too much snow, we have to <F>er</F> take off the <F>er</F> snow from the roof. <R>It's</R> it's kind of so trouble you know, <F>er</F> you have to do it perhaps three times <.></.> or four times <SC>a year</SC> <SC>a</SC> <R>in a</R> in a season. <R>You</R> you have to pay, if you ask somebody else, a lot of money, so <R>it's</R> it's not a good point to live there <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mmm</F> O K. Alright. <F>Er</F>, so I think you're very busy, but in your free time what do you usually do?</A>
<B>Over there?</B>
<A><F>Ah</F> no. In <H pn="others7">XXX09</H>.</A>
<B>In <H pn="others7">XXX09</H>? <F>Mm</F> you know, I'm not so young so perhaps I just <F>er</F> relax at home <F>erm</F> and do <F>er</F> tiny stuff at home like <F>er</F> cleaning <nvs>laughter</nvs> washing <F>er</F> clothes you know, that kind, just plain thing. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>O K, Alright, so the first thing today. O K. please take a look at this picture and please describe the picture to me.</A>
<B><F>Ahh</F> I don't know <.></.> to whom she is <nvs>laughter</nvs> talking or looking you know or, I can't tell her eyeline, yes, or <nvs>laughter</nvs>. But <R>I</R> I think <SC>she is not</SC> <R>she is</R> she is kind of in a certain level of <F>er</F> <F>er</F> a civilized or educated <F>er</F> background. Because she is having you know, <SC>elctric</SC> <F>er</F> <R>el</R> electric or electronic appliances around her. And also she loves <F>er</F> pets <.></.> but I wonder if she <.></.> has some difficulties in hearing. Maybe this is kind of <nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>hearing aid</laughter> dog. Because you know, <SC>we</SC> here in Japan, we do not <F>er</F> have a dog inside of the room. <F>Er</F>. Usually we keep dogs <F>er</F> out of the house you know <nvs>laughter</nvs> so this is kind of <R>one</R> one thing I'm <F>er</F> concerned <nvs>laughter</nvs>. <F>Well</F> <.></.> I don't know <R>any</R> anything else, <R>you</R> you would like to hear?</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. <F>Oh</F> that's O K. <F>Er</F> what do you think this dog is doing in this room? You mentioned that.</A>
<B>Yeah. Yeah. <R>I</R> I think <R>he</R> he is just prepared for her helping <F>er</F> <F>er</F> when somebody visits her or need boiling some water or you know, <nvs>laughter</nvs> then <R>he</R> <.></.> he will <F>er</F> <F>er</F> tell her that something is happening. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>O K. Alright. <F>er</F> Do you use computer?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F> <F>er</F>. What are some of the advantage of using the computer?</A>
<B><F>Mm</F>. It's easy to re-writing, <.></.> very handy. And <F>er</F> <F>er</F> easier to calculate <F>mm</F> and <F>er</F> nowadays it's very convenient to know something around the world, <.></.> by using Internet or e-mail, that kind. So computer is so very <F>er</F> <R>good</R> good thing. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>

<A>Why didn't you check when you bought it?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. Because I love this pattern. You know, I love this color. <nvs>laughter</nvs> That's why I bought this.</B>
<A>Then why don't you keep it?</A>
<B>But <R>I</R> I prefer to have a bigger one, bigger size.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. I'm sorry, ma'am, but that's against our policy.</A>
<B>Policy?</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. That's against <R>our</R> our store policy.</A>
<B>Yes, but <R>I</R> I didn't use this one yet and <F>er</F> I think <F>er</F> <F>er</F> you know, cooling-off for that kind, <R>I</R> I can <F>er</F> return this to you. And <F>er</F> <R>you</R> you can give me <F>er</F> the one I want or maybe <R>you</R> you can <F>er</F> <SC>give me the money</SC> <SC>pay</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> or pay me?</B>
<A>But you said that you like the color and design.</A>

<A><F>Mm</F>. What do you mean by quality?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> <F>er</F>. <R>I</R> I want to have <F>er</F> some <F>mm</F> natural stuff <F>er</F> <SC>one hundred percent cotton</SC> <R>one hundred percent</R> I mean pure silk, <F>er</F> or <F>er</F> linen?</B>
