<B><F>Um</F> yes. <F>Um</F> I missed my train <F>er</F> this morning because <SC>of</SC> <F>er</F> the <F>er</F> local train stopped. And <F>er</F> I would like my <F>er</F> reserve tickets <F>um</F> <F>er</F> exchanged with another ticket or maybe <F>er</F> get <SC>the</SC> my money back.</B>
<A>I'm really sorry. But that's against our policy. <OL>We can't</OL> do that.</A>

<B><F>Um</F> <F>well</F> first, <R>I</R> I <F>er</F> woke up late. <nvs>sniff</nvs> And <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I ran to the <F>er</F> local station but the train wasn't coming.

<B><F>Ah</F> <OL>no</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I mean, you</OL> missed a train or the airplane?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> my father, when we were on a family trip, <F>er</F> he missed <F>er</F> our plane because <F>er</F> <F>um</F> <SC>he</SC> my father forgot the time. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And <F>er</F> <R>we</R> we tried to get the next <F>um</F> fastest plane ticket.

<A>O K. And have you ever traveled alone?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> alone. No, I haven't. <F>Oh</F> actually, <R>I</R> I've been on a plane alone. Because <F>er</F> when I was living in America, my sister was going to college in Japan. I was visiting my sister. So <F>um</F> I had a chance to go on a plane by myself.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>

<task>
<A>Now, <F>hm</F> I'll give you another picture <?>for you</?>.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is selecting a card.</ctxt>
<A>This time, please make a short story using these six pictures. But this happened last week.</A>
<B>Last week.</B>
<A>So please start your story with "One day last week".</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking at the pictures.</ctxt>
<B><F>Er</F> one day last week, <F>er</F> Tom was driving his car <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>er</F> to his office <?>this</?> morning. And <F>er</F> <..></..> <F>er</F> the opposing lane, <F>er</F> Chris was on his motorcycle. And <F>er</F> while he was driving, he was making a call to his girlfriend. <nvs>sniff</nvs> And <R>as</R> <F>er</F> as Tom was trying to make a left turn, <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>er</F> Chris's cell phone hit his <F>er</F> side mirror and <F>er</F> crashed into the back part of his motorcycle. <nvs>sniff</nvs> So <F>er</F> he stopped. They had an argument that <F>er</F> Tom wasn't looking when he was turning <?>to</?> his car. And Chris wanted his bike to be repaired with his money. <nvs>smack</nvs> So <F>er</F> eventually they called the police. <nvs>sniff</nvs> And <F>er</F> Tom told the officer <nvs>smack</nvs> that Chris was calling on the phone while he was driving and that he was <F>er</F> not driving safely. <nvs>sniff</nvs> <R>So</R> <F>er</F> <..></..> so the police officer gave <F>er</F> Chris the ticket <nvs>sniff</nvs> for not driving safely and <F>er</F> his bike was towed away.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>All right, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> <JP>san</JP>, do you have a driver's license?</A>
<B>No, I don't.</B>
<A>No? O K. Do you want to have a license?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> maybe in America. Not in Japan.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Because <F>er</F> there are a lot of traffic jams. And I think <F>um</F> the train system, subway and railway, and the bus system is very <F>er</F> convenient. So I think it's just a waste of money <nvs>laughter</nvs> to pay for <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the automobile and like the <SC>gas</SC> gasoline payments. <CO>So</CO>. <nvs>sniff</nvs></B>
<A>O K. So in America, how do people get a license?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> they go to driving school. <OL><nvs>sniff</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>And <F>er</F> <F>ah</F> actually in high school, they have a driving class, <SC>which</SC> <F>er</F> you could get <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the license before the permanent one. <F>Um</F> <nvs>smack</nvs> so you could either <SC>get it</SC> get at least <F>er</F> the <F>er</F> license in high school or you can commute to a driver's school</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and get your license there.</B>
<A>That's good. O K. Then the last question is that <F>um</F> <F>hm</F> what do you think of the <F>er</F> manners of drivers <OL>in Japan</OL>?</A>
<B><OL>Manner of drivers</OL>. <F>Um</F> <..></..> <F>er</F> I think <R>it's</R> <F>er</F> <F>hm</F> it's bad. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Um</F> <..></..> <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I haven't actually been on a road in Japan so <F>er</F> I'm not really sure, but as I look at people from the sidewalk, <nvs>sniff</nvs> I see people shaving <nvs>laughter</nvs> in the car. I see people talking on the phone <F>um</F> or throwing cigarettes out the window. <nvs>sniff</nvs> And <F>er</F> <R>I think</R> I think that's very dangerous. Since <F>er</F> <SC>car commuters are very</SC> <F>er</F> <R>there're</R> there're <SC>very</SC> a lot of <?>them</?> so I think they should be more careful.</B>
<A>Yeah. O K. Yeah. I think so, too. I want you to be a very good driver. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
