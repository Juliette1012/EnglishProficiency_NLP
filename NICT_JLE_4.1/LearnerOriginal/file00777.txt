<A><F>Huum</F>. What's good about snowboarding?</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F>. <F>Well</F> it's fun because I've tried skiing before but I never did it well, I never successed with it, so I tried it when I was about sixteen years old and I enjoyed it so I'm doing it for about four or five years since then. Three years since then. <.></.></B>

<B>Describe this picture?</B>
<A>Yes.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Well</F> <nvs>coughs</nvs> a young type of lady teacher is teaching mathematics, I guess, for the students that seems to be around the age of fifteen, sixteen, but the students are doing <.></.> what they want to for themselves and only one you know, <.></.> smart kind of boy is listening to her class. <..></..> And it seems to me that students have no uniforms for them and I guess this teacher is bit you know, <F>um</F> <F>uhm</F> <F>uhm</F> poor in this situation.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Huum</F>. O K, thank you very much, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Can you compare this picture to the classroom you had when you're a high school student?</A>
<B>In my high school. <F>Uhm</F>. My high school didn't have any girls in my class, so that part is bit different. And of course we didn't drink or have chewing gums while class time and <..></..> the thing they wear about is that <F>um</F> we had the rule that we could wear uniform and your private <F>uhm</F> clothes so <.></.> you know, the scene isn't that odd for me. But you know, drinkings and chewings are <R>com</R> completely <?>stop</?> and we didn't have any young teachers, lady teachers. And but the class size and how the desks are lined up looks the same in my high school.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. <F>Hum</F>. You said this teacher is poor.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Why do you think so?</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F>. It looks as she's trying to teach <.></.> math for every students hardly but <.></.> I'm afraid there's no one listening to her. So <F>um</F> <?>ashamed</?>.</B>
