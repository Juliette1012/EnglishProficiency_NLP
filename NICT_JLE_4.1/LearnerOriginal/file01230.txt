<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I think it was in a <laughter>better way</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. O K. All right.</A>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>So we have a few things to do today. And first I want you to describe a picture for me. And why don't you try this one?</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>Tell me anything you see.</A>
<B>O K. I think it's a <R>mathe</R> mathematic class. Actually <R>o</R> only one person listening to the teacher but others are just playing around,</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>reading</OL>, E-mailing, wondering around, and talking to each other. <..></..> <??></??> sunny day. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>Anything else?</A>
<B>It's really <F>hm</F> diverse. American, Asian, I don't know,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>so many races.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>More?</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> O K. <OL>Fine</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
</task>
<followup>
<A>O K. So you mentioned that <F>er</F> you liked <F>er</F> the school in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> better. Can you compare a typical <SC>classroom of</SC> <F>er</F> high school classroom in <F>er</F> the States that you went to and</A>
<B>Here?</B>
<A>the, yeah, here. Can you compare?</A>
<B>The class was so much smaller</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>so that</OL> teacher could teach individually,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>ask questions.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah. I think, yeah, people study more <laughter>there, I think</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I don't know. I never seen like people sleeping in a class.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><CO>But here, <SC>I s</SC> I often see them s</CO>. <OL>You know</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>Yeah. I was really surprised when I came like four months ago or five.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <F>Um</F> <F>er</F> but what do <F>er</F> <R>o</R> other students do when there's someone sleeping in the classroom?</A>
<B>In the U S?</B>
<A><F>Uh</F> <F>ah</F> no, no, no, <OL>here</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><F>Uh</F> here</OL>? We would just <laughter>ignore it</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>We just leave them alone.</B>
<A>And what about the teacher?</A>
<B>Some teachers say just "Wake up," but others, no, they don't really care, I think. I don't know, they just <??></??> go on or they just don't notice that because <SC>they're</SC> <SC>like they're re</SC> they're busy like teaching or, I don't know.</B>

<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Er</F> <SC>what about the teach</SC> can you compare the teachers?</A>
<B>Teachers. <F>Hm</F>. In <F>er</F> here, I think, <SC>teacher</SC> <SC>all the</SC> almost all the teachers <SC>sa</SC> teach the same way, kind of. They just read the textbook and follow the textbook.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>In the</OL> U S, <SC>they just</SC> like all the teacher teach like differently.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Or different stuff even though there're like class names, <OL>like</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>"History" or like "American History" like</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>there are like five teachers working.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But like all the teachers saying like differently, like, I don't know, all the tests are different.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But here, like everyone take the like exactly the same test, so</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>it's really different.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. Bet it is. O K.</A>

<B><F>Er</F>.</B>
<A>Missed an appointment or been late for class?</A>
<B><.></.> Not really.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Um</F> <F>er</F> do you come to school by train?</A>
<B>Yes, <OL>I do</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <F>Er</F> what was the most <R>interest</R> interesting thing that you ever seen on the train in Japan?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> <F>um</F> <.></.> <??></??> <?>I don't know</?>. I've never taken the train in the U S.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>because</OL> we didn't need it <OL>or</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>yeah, I don't see it. So when I came here and when I realized that I had to take a train to go to <R>sc</R> school, <SC>I was</SC> <F>er</F> it took me like an hour to go to school.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And I couldn't believe how long it <laughter>takes</laughter> to go to like some place to the other.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>Because</SC> yeah, because when I was in the U S, it only took me like fifteen minutes <SC>by a car</SC> with a car, so that was really surprising.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>And</OL> the Japanese trains are like <?>like</?> it's too crowded in the morning <OL>especially</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><CO>I think <SC>it's sma</SC> it's too small or something or</CO>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>It's <laughter>really</laughter> crowded.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><SC>Like</SC> but <SC>they don't</SC> I think Japanese people, they don't really care <SC>how</SC> about like touching other people's body, because in the U S, like people really care. Like, you know,</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>when they</OL> have like contact with others,</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>they just say</OL> "Excuse me.".</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>But <R>i</R></OL> in Japan, like nobody say like "Excuse me" or <OL>anything</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. <F>Ahh</F>.</A>
<B>They just <?>stay</?> <OL><??></??></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><?>place</?>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>I think <R>it's</R></OL> it's really interesting</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>how people don't care about touching <?>themselves</?>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. I guess it is different.</A>
