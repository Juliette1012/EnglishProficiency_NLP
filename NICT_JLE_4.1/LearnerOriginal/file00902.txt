<A>Hello, my name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have your name, please?</A>

<B>Nice to meet you, too.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. So it's a beautiful day today.</A>
<B>Yeah, it is.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> What do you like to do on such a day?</A>
<B><F>Uum</F>. I'm rather to go out with lunch, and maybe lie on a grass in a park.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> I see. <F>Mm</F>. It's a nice campus here. Can you tell me about the school?</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F>. <H pn="school name1">XXX03</H> used to locate in <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> or <H pn="others2">XXX05</H> area long time ago. And it moves here also long time ago. And <F>um</F> most of the students are studying education. And <R>we have</R> <SC>we have every sub</SC> <F>eh</F> <F>ur</F> we have special courses for every subject in school. So I think <F>mm</F> this is one of the biggest university in Japan.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. And what do you do here?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. I am majoring in English education, and I'm a graduate student here. And this is my last year. And I'm now working on my thesis. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> I see. <F>Um</F>. And how do you feel about being in your last year?</A>
<B><F>Uhh</F>. I feel very sad actually because I'm going back to my hometown next spring. And this year would be my last year in Tokyo also. So after writing my thesis, I'm planning to go out many fun places in Tokyo.</B>
<A><F>Hum</F>. Can you tell me about your hometown?</A>
<B><F>Um</F>. I'm from <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>, and my hometown is famous for rice, Uonuma Koshihikari. And we have lots of mountain, and we can enjoy skiing in winter. <F>Urm</F> <F>oh</F> and my hometown has a <JP>shinkansen</JP> station. But <nvs>laughter</nvs> around the station, we can see only rice fields, and <nvs>laughter</nvs> no other buildings are higher than the <JP>shinkansen</JP> station there.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Hum</F>. What's so great about that special rice?</A>
<B><F>Uhm</F> <F>uum</F> <F>well</F> I can not really compare it to other kinds, but my father always tells me that the Koshihikari rice is the best one in Japan, and I believe <R>in</R> in him so. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>

</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A>Now, the first thing I'd like you to do is to describe this picture.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>.</B>
<A>O K?</A>
<B>O K. <F>Um</F>. A girl is in her own room, and she is sitting in front of her computer. And she keeps two animals. One is dog, and another is a cat. And they're also in her room. And she has a big bed and <.></.> big stereo set and her own telephone and some books and nice blue clock on the wall. And it seems to be in June because she has a calendar of June. <F>Uh</F> also she has a typewriter of pink color. So maybe she's working on something, maybe thesis. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> I see. Thank you.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A>So could you please compare this room with <SC>your own room</SC> <OL>your apartment</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><F>Uum</F></OL> <F>well</F>, <.></.> it looks very similar to my own room because I have computer and stereo set <SC>and m</SC> and bed and clock. But I don't have pets because I'm living in a <?>friend</?>, <R>not</R> not <?>right</?> room. So I'm not allowed to keep any kinds of pets in my room. But I think her room is little bit wider than mine. And little bit cleaner maybe. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F> I like my room though.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. O K. And you mentioned that she might be working on her thesis.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><R>And</R> and you are as well.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. How do you work on your thesis?</A>

And I have to start typing in my <SC>other results</SC> <?>answer of</?> questionnaires with my computer. And also I have to look for so many examples from previous studies. So <F>mm</F> I can imagine it's gonna be really hard for the <R>next</R> next coming two months. It's due to the end of January.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>. Good luck. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>

And <SC>I can't</SC> I don't have enough money to buy another dress by tomorrow. So <F>um</F> I don't care about colors. So if I can find any kinds of dress that <SC>fits</SC> just fit me, so please could you <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>uh</F> exchange the dress to another one? If it costs little bit higher, I can pay for that. But <SC>I can'</SC> I don't have <F>um</F> money to buy another dress so please. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
