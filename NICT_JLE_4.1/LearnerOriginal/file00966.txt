<B><F>Umm</F> <F>umm</F>. I like to live in <F>ahh</F> not busy place like Tokyo. <F>Umm</F> so I feel very comfortable here.</B>

<A>I see.</A>
<B><F>Umm</F>.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F> <F>well</F> his job is kind of different from yours, but <F>ahh</F> <SC>how</SC> <R>wh</R> where did you meet?</A>
<B><F>Um</F> actually he's from the same university.</B>

<B><F>Umm</F>. It doesn't suit him,</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>.</A>
<B>and I thought so, too. He likes to make a communication with people more than to do things with other scientists. <F>Umm</F>.</B>
<A>That's very understandable.</A>
<B><F>Umm</F> <F>um</F>.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much.</A>

<A><F>Umm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Umm</F> <F>um</F> <F>um</F>.</B>

<B><F>Umm</F> Not in America. <SC>I was</SC> I lived in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>, so it's a little bit different, <F>umm</F> I think.</B>
<A><F>Umm</F> What's the <F>uu</F> difference?</A>
<B><F>Umm</F> <R>in</R> in my own opinion <F>umm</F> like <R>I</R> I think it's because I see like American movies <OL><laughter>and then</laughter></OL>,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>.</A>
<B>when there's a scene,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>

<A>Sorry, you can't. <F>Well</F> it's against our policy because it was on sale.</A>
<B><F>Mmm</F> I understand it was on sale, but <F>umm</F> <R>even</R> even that, I heard that <R>if</R> if it's not a sale, <F>umm</F> you can have it back, so I definitely want the money back.</B>
<A><F>Ohh</F>.</A>

<A><F>Oh</F> really?</A>
<B><laughter><R>Right</R></laughter> right.</B>
<A>So you like to waste your money?</A>
<B><F>Umm</F> <.></.> not often this kind of thing happens to me so. <F>Um</F> <F>um</F>. But even if I don't like it, I go to a recycle shop and then sell it.</B>
<A><F>Wow</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>um</F>.</B>
<A>O K. So tell me about a recycle shop <F>ahh</F> you usually go to.</A>
<B><F>Um</F> <F>um</F>.</B>
<A><R>What</R> what kind of recycle shop?</A>
<B><F>Ummm</F> recently there's many recycle shops in Japan. And they sell many things like clothes or toys or like electric things.</B>
<A><F>Uh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So they would buy it from us and sell it as a reasonable price.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really?</A>
<B><F>Umm</F>.</B>
<A>That's a good idea.</A>
<B>Yeah. <F>Um</F> <F>um</F>.</B>
<A>O K. <F>Well</F> about <R>your</R> your trip to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. <F>Umm</F> <F>well</F> did you have some experience that <R>you</R> <SC>you were</SC> like you were in trouble in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>?</A>
<B><F>Umm</F> <SC>I went to the</SC> <F>umm</F> I went to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> when I was about eight years old.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And I stayed there for four years.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>And because I was a child <F>umm</F> <SC>I first</SC> when I first went to the class, I didn't know any English because my parents had a policy not to <SC>teach English</SC> force me to <F>um</F> teach English before I go there.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>So I didn't know anything and I was so confused, so I had some trouble, <R>but</R> but everybody was so kind and the teacher was so kind, too. <F>Umm</F>.</B>
<A>Sounds so nice.</A>
<B><F>Umm</F>.</B>
<A><R>What</R> what was the most exciting <R>e</R> experience in those days? Do you remember?</A>
<B><F>Umm</F>. One point that I was very very <F>umm</F> that reminds me of the experience in U K. <F>Umm</F> I couldn't speak English and in the morning, the teacher <F>um</F> calls everybody's name, <SC>whether they're</SC> whether he or she is here or not. And when she asks my name, <F>um</F> I didn't answer anything for like month or two months.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B><SC>And</SC> but everybody was <F>um</F> answering "Yes, Mrs Teacher or something.". So I once tried for first time, and when I tried, everybody was so happy and everybody was so like fascinating. And I mean, <R>I</R> I think that kind of <F>um</F> atmosphere doesn't happen in Japan. <SC>I didn't</SC> I haven't experienced anything in Japan. So I thought, "<F>Wow</F> this English people <SC>was</SC> is very very nice and kind.". <OL><F>Umm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Wow</F></OL>.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
