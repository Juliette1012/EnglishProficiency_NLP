<B><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</B>
<A>let's begin. <F>Hm</F>. O K. Hi. May I help you, ma'am?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> yes. Actually I was going to take <F>er</F> the train started at three P. M. but I missed the train by a small accident. So could you please exchange the ticket or <SC>can I</SC> <F>um</F> <F>mm</F> could you give back the money for me?</B>
<A>I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can't.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> but <F>um</F> <F>er</F> <SC>I u</SC> actually I took a bus to get to the train and <?>bus has</?> a little accident <F>um</F> which was out of my plan. So I could be on time to take the train but there was accident and <F>um</F> I hope you can <SC>apecs</SC> accept the situation and change <R>the</R> the train ticket, please.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> <F>well</F> but we haven't got any report about the accidents.</A>
<B><F>Oh</F>. <CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>How can you prove it?</A>
<B><F>Oh</F> so O K. How about I go to the bus office now and I try to make <F>er</F> <SC>the proof</SC> <F>uh</F> some kind of notes to prove the accident? So I'll come back here in one hour. So if I have the sheets of paper, could you exchange for day to maybe tomorrow?</B>
<A>Yeah. But <F>um</F> it's a holiday season. The most of trains are full. One after from now is O K to make a reservation but after that, <F>um</F> you cannot have any reservation today.</A>
<B>O K. So I'll definitely come back here <R>in one</R> in one hour or so. I promise to come back here, and hopefully, <nvs>laughter</nvs> I can get the money back and <R>re</R> reserve for the next train.</B>
<A>Yeah? You will try?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>O K</laughter> then. <F>Oh</F> I'm waiting. You're coming back. O K. <F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>Thank you very much.</B>
<A>O K. Thank you very much. This is the end of the <laughter>interview</laughter>.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A>So do you like traveling?</A>
<B>I do.</B>
<A>Yeah?</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>So <F>well</F> could you compare traveling <F>er</F> in Japan to traveling abroad?</A>
<B><F>Ahh</F>. <F>Well</F> <F>well</F> I guess traveling in Japan is much easier because I don't have to speak English and I can usually understand all circumstances like transportation situations or <F>oh</F> of course culture as <F>well</F>. But the travel abroad is also fun because I always find <F>er</F> new things and that's very good study for me. And also I can practice my English. So I like both. But one thing I don't like about travel is I hate packing.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>So <nvs>laughter</nvs> that's the biggest problem for me.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Whether I go either Japan or abroad, I usually hate packing. So that's a big <laughter>problem</laughter>.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. So what's the most important thing to decide a place to travel for you?</A>
<B><F>Er</F> I guess the most important thing is if I really interest in the place.</B>
<A>For example?</A>
<B>For example, I like art. <F>Er</F> I took art history class <SC?>this</SC?> <?>last</?> year <SC>so</SC> and <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> I'm interested in European art, so I usually pick up places where the famous museums are like especially I love London because they have a lot of galleries and art museums there. So <SC?>I ne</SC?> I went there a couple of times. And I haven't finished yet to see all the galleries and museums.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>. <F>Hm</F>. O K.</A>
</followup>
</stage3>
<stage4>
<task>
<A>So <F>er</F> finally, I will show you another picture. O K. Let's see. O K.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is selecting a card.</ctxt>
<A><F>Hm</F>. <F>Er</F> no, no, sorry. I'll change my mind.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>. <F>Uh</F>. <F>Uh</F>. Sorry. <F>Er</F> do you have <laughter>a</laughter> <F>um</F> paper of picture?</A>
<B><F>Uh</F>. Yeah. This one?</B>
<A>Yeah, yeah. So could you open the page <F>um</F> twenty-four?</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking for the page.</ctxt>
<A>Can you <R>s</R> see six-sequence pictures?</A>
<B>Actually, <SC?>j</SC?> <F>um</F> the page number is written like F one or B one.</B>
<A>O K, then. I'll try to do it. <R>Twenty</R> twenty-four. </A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is operating the keyboard.</ctxt>
<A><F>Oh</F>. O K, <SC>s</SC> <F>oh</F> O K. <SC>P</SC> let's see, <R>P</R> P six.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewee is looking for the page.</ctxt>
<B><F>Uh</F> this one?</B>
<A>Exactly. Yes. So could you make up a story using those six pictures?</A>
<B><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</B>
<A>And this happened last week.</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So could you start your story with "One day last week"?</A>
<B>One day last week, a friend of mine was dating with her boyfriend. But that was raining. And when they were walking on the street, they could hear <F>uh</F> a little noise and it sounded like <F>er</F> the cat's meowing. So they opened the box <?>besides a tree</?> and there was <F>er</F> one kitten in the box. And <F>er</F> my friend really wanted to have the kitty because she was really pretty. But the boyfriend was kind of thinking <SC>where</SC> <R>wha</R> what he should do. But she <SC>asks</SC> asked for <?>me</?> so many times so <SC>she fi</SC> <F>uh</F> he finally accepted her. And they decided to take the kitten and brought the <R>kit</R> kitten to their home.</B>
<A>O K.</A>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Hm</F>. So <F>um</F> O K, <R>wh</R> what do you do, <F>hm</F> if you have a disagreement with your boyfriend or <F>er</F> you against <F>er</F> <SC>something what you said</SC> I mean <F>mm</F> something what he said?</A>
<B><??></??></B>
<A>How do you usually solve the problem?</A>
<B>I usually <SC>try to explain</SC> I mean, try to talk like why you think so and why I don't think so. And think that I try to make a compromise which both of us can agree.</B>
<A><OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</A>
<B><OL><??></??></OL> that's the solution.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>. If you don't mind, could you tell me <F>er</F> if you had some argument with him?</A>
<B><F>Er</F>.</B>
<A>Could you tell me about that? <F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>From my experience? <nvs>laughter</nvs> I don't know. Or I haven't had that kind of a situation. But it's a little bit different, but I had a lot of a similar situation as this cat's story. <F>Um</F> I really love cat and wanted to have a cat. But my mother didn't want to have any cat because <R>she</R> she loves dogs but she didn't like cat because she never had <SC>c</SC> a cat. But one day, <?>one of our</?> friend told me that her friend find <F>er</F> the stray cat, a kitten. And her friend's friend was looking for someone to take care of the cat. So I said her <R>I</R> I want to have the cat because I really wanted to. But my mother said no, because she hated cat. But <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>actually <SC>she</SC> my mom</SC> and also that my mom went to travel. So I decided to have a cat</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>while she was <SC>not <SC>in</SC> at</SC> not at home. So asked <nvs>laughter</nvs> my friends to bring the cat. And now we're having a cat, and my mom's <R>loves</R> loves him.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B><?>The cat</?>.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL>O K</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>So</OL> it wasn't <laughter>compromising</laughter>.</B>
<A><SC?>That</SC?> <R>that's</R> <OL>that's O K, yeah</OL>.</A>
