<A>O K. All right. Thank you very much. <F>Umm</F> <F>erm</F>. What do you think of the people who are talking <F>erm</F> on the mobile phone in a train?</A>
<B>In the train?</B>
<A>Yeah.</A>
<B>If it's very short, I don't mind. But, if it starts <R>to</R> to become very long, I'll start being bothered <.></.> because, <F>er</F> normally, <F>er</F> <SC>the train</SC> <R>in</R> in the train in Japan, is very quiet. And <F>er</F> people tend <R>to</R> to talk in a quiet voice. And also not only the mobile phone, but people who are <SC>listening on</SC> listening <SC>the</SC> their M D <F>er</F> and also the C D player on the train, and even they use the earphone, the sound will come out. And that is sometimes bothering.</B>
