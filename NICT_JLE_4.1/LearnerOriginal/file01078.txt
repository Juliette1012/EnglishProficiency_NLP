<A><F>Ah</F>. My name is <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. May I have your name, please?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>O K. <CO><OL>Nice to meet</OL></CO>.</A>
<B><OL><?>A very</?></OL> rare name. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs> Yeah. <F>Ah</F>. Nice to meet you.</A>
<B><OL>Nice to meet you</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>Can I call you</OL> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>Yes? <F>Um</F>. So <F>ahm</F> how are you this morning?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. I am doing quite well, but <F>ahm</F> because recently, I am quite busy with <F>ah</F> <?>many</?> work and also I am going to get married <SC>in</SC> from two weeks. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. Two weeks? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><CO>I am quite</CO></OL>. In two weeks, so I am a bit sleepy. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> I see. <F>Um</F>. <F>Ahm</F>. How do you enjoy your married life?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> <F>well</F>. Actually, when I go home, <R>my</R> my husband is <R>alrea</R> already asleep so <F>ah</F> we don't have that much conversation after all right now. So <F>ahm</F> I can't say that <F>ah</F> <R>my</R> my marriage life is <F>ahm</F> wonderful <OL><laughter>at the moment but</laughter></OL>,</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><F>ah</F> <.></.> I have to try <OL>to <??></??> communication</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah-huh</F> <F>ah</F></OL>. Why do you come back so late?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> because of my work.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>. <F>Hum</F>. Do you enjoy your work?</A>
<B><laughter><F>Ahm</F> yes</laughter>. Though it's a bit tough physically. And <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> I'm working in the <SC?>head</SC?> hair care marketing division. And I like to deal with those hear care products, so <F>erm</F> regarding that point, I enjoy my work. But physically,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>my body is <laughter><F>ah</F></laughter> saying that is too tough. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> I see. O K.</A>
<B><F>Hm</F>.</B>
<A>So you said your name is very rare.</A>
<B><OL>Yes</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Er</F></OL> can I ask you where your name come from?</A>
<B>O K. So <F>ahm</F> my parents are from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> <R>so</R> <F>ah</F> so they have <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> kind of traditional Japanese idea that <F>ah</F> woman should be quiet and polite. And therefore, my name has <F>erm</F> a character of quiet and polite together.</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> And so my surname <F>ah</F> I don't know <R>about</R> about my origin,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>but <F>ah</F> at least my parents are from <F>ah</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> and there are some <?>met</?> relatives,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> with my <F>ah</F> surname, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>ah</F> I don't know. Maybe <F>ah</F> origin is from Korea or China. <OL>I don't know</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><??></??></OL></A>
<B><??></??></B>
<A>And do you like your name?</A>
<B>Yes, <R>because my</R> <F>ah</F> because my <R>na</R> name is quite rare,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>people would remember <F>ah</F> <R>at least</R> <R>if</R> if they couldn't remember all, at least they remember like <F>ahm</F> somebody whose name is quite rare,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>so I like my name.</B>
<A>I see. O K. Do you think you are the person like your name?</A>
<B><.></.> Quiet and polite?</B>
<A>Yes. <nvs>cough</nvs></A>
<B><F>Ah</F> I try to be polite,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>but for quietness, <F>ahm</F> if I keep quiet in this company,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>I can't do my job. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><F>Ah</F> I don't think I am quiet, honestly.</B>
</stage1>
<stage2>
<task>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>. <laughter>O K, I understand</laughter>. All right. Now, I'm going to show you a picture.</A>
<ctxt>The interviewer is taking out a picture.</ctxt>
<A>So look at this picture and describe it for me.</A>
<B>All right. <F>Ahm</F>. This seems to be in <F>ah</F> the situation in schools, probably high school.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F>. But it seems quite <R>un</R> unorganized because the teacher is doing <F>ah</F> her lesson <.></.> on her own and actually <SC>nobody is</SC> <F>well</F> only one person up front,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>this boy is listening to her.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>uh</F> other than that, <F>ahm</F> everybody is doing their own job, <F>um</F> these girls are talking, and this boy is listening to music with <F>ahm</F> drink in hand.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So <F>ahm</F> it doesn't look quite a good lesson,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and I suppose that <F>ahm</F> the lesson is not that much interesting</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B><R>for</R> for these students.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>Yes. And I think that's mathematics. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Um</F>. <F>Ah</F>. <F>Ah</F> <F>ah</F> <R>sha</R> shall I continue <OL><??></??></OL>?</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah</F> that's O K</OL>. <F>Ah</F> that's enough. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><laughter><F>Ah</F> O K</laughter></OL>.</B>
</task>
<followup>
<A><F>Ah</F>. Is this picture <F>ah</F> similar to your class when you were a student?</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> <F>well</F>. <F>Um</F>. <..></..> In terms of the clothes <SC>they wear</SC> the students wear, <F>ahm</F> we had uniform,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>so it looks like more organized because everybody's wearing the same thing <laughter>so</laughter> <R>more</R> more, <F>ahm</F> how can I say, yes, organized than this picture.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>ahm</F> <laughter>about the lesson</laughter>, there were some people <F>ah</F> talking during the lesson. So <SC>it</SC> that's the same thing. But at least we didn't have anyone <F>er</F> who were chewing gum <laughter>in a lesson</laughter>, <SC>so</SC> <F>ahm</F> but I think at anytime <F>ahm</F> students will enjoy <SC>their life</SC> <F>ahm</F> their young life, so <F>ahm</F> <R>in that</R> in that sense, the <SC>atmosphere</SC> total atmosphere, it's similar to <R>my</R> my <F>ahm</F> experience in high school.</B>
<A>I see. <F>Hm</F>. O K. <F>Ah</F>. What do you think of wearing uniform?</A>
<B>Wearing uniform. <F>Well</F>. <.></.> <F>Ah</F>. I know that <SC>somebody says that they</SC> somebody say that <F>ahm</F> they don't like <F>ahm</F> uniform, but personally, I like uniform because I don't have to think for <??></??> in the morning what to wear so it's quite practical.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B>So and I keep my uniform now.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> really? All right. O K. Thank you.</A>
<B>Thank you.</B>
</followup>
</stage2>
<stage3>
<task>
<A>Now, next we will do a role-play. Do you know what the role-play is?</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. O K. So this is your role.</A>
<B><F>Um</F>.</B>
<A>And I will be your clerk of <R>tra</R> travel agency. <F>Um</F>.</A>
<B><F>Um</F>.</B>
<ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt>
<A>When you are ready, please start. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B><OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>. <F>Um</F>. <R>So</R> so I've already <.></.> taken this trip, right? <F>Ah</F> O K. <.></.> O K. <F>ahm</F> so it's on the phone, right? O K. <F>Ah</F> hello?</B>
<A>Hello?</A>
<B><F>Erm</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ahm</F>. I joined your <F>ahm</F> <F>ahm</F> pack trip <F>ahm</F> last week to Germany, and I know that <F>ahm</F> we are going to go around <SC>with the bus, but in fact</SC> <F>ah</F> with a comfortable bus but in fact the bus was really small and <F>ahm</F> <?>everything</?> was packed together in a very, very small <F>ahm</F> bus, and I wouldn't say that it was a comfortable trip. <F>Ahm</F>. <F>Ah</F>. <F>Aa</F>. And in addition to that, I know that <F>erm</F> the last night of the trip, we will have a German traditional meal, but actually it was just a hamburger with <F>ah</F> some French fries.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And I don't think that was a <.></.> traditional German meal, so <F>ahm</F> I suppose <F>ah</F> there is a exaggeration in your brochure of the <F>ahm</F> this pack tour.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ahm</F>. Could you explain how this happened?</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. <F>Ahm</F>. Actually, we had less people so the bus was small.</A>
<B>Less people than <??></??> <OL>you mean</OL>?</B>
<A><OL><F>Ah-huh</F></OL>.</A>
<B>So <F>ahm</F> I know that the bus was going to be large enough <R>to</R> <F>ahm</F> to make us all comfortable. So in fact, we had to use the spare seats,</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>so <SC>somebody</SC> someone <F>ah</F> fall down in the bus because <??></??> <R>without the</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <??></??> difficult,</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>well</F> without the seat's belt, so I don't think it was a comfortable trip <OL>at all</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL> I see. O K. <F>Ahm</F>. We will investigate <??></??>.</A>
<B><F>Ah</F> thank you.</B>
<A>And <F>er</F> the hamburger and French fries <?>though</?>, <F>ah</F> there're old German hamburgers and French fries.</A>
<B>Yeah, but <F>ahm</F></B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>according to the brochure of <F>erm</F> <F>ah</F> <SC>the trip</SC> the pack trip, <F>ahm</F> it sounded like <F>ahm</F> more special <?>case</?></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><F>er</F> with <F>ahm</F> traditional German beer.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>ahm</F> we actually <F>ahm</F> had <F>ahm</F> hamburger which we could have in MacDonald's in Japan. So <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>we were completely <F>ahm</F> unhappy <R>with</R> with <R?>that</R?> that meal.</B>
<A><F>Mhm-huh</F>. <F>Um</F>. But you chose the cheapest trip.</A>
<B>Yeah, but <SC>this</SC> <F>er</F> it didn't say anything <F>ahm</F> about the relation between the cost <R>and the</R> and <F>ah</F> the meals and <R>the</R> the last night, so <F>ah</F> we were not convinced with <SC>that</SC> <F>ahm</F> <F>erm</F> the reason of the cost.</B>
<A><F>Um</F>. I see. <F>Ahm</F>. What should we do for you?</A>
<B><F>Ahm</F>. So at least, we would like to <F>ahm</F> explain <R>with</R> <F>ah</F> with <F>ah</F> documents <F>ahm</F> <SC>why</SC> <R>ho</R> how <F>ahm</F> <SC>could ha</SC> could this has happened</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and <F>ahm</F> <F>ah</F> maybe you could also offer us some <F>ahm</F> <.></.> coupon</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>for the next trip. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> O K. <F>Nn</F>. <F>Er</F> I will ask the conductor.</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>And I'll find what really happened there. O K. <laughter>Thank you very much</laughter>.</A>
<B><laughter>Thank you very much</laughter>. <OL><laughter>Quite difficult</laughter></OL>.</B>

<B><F>Um</F>. O K. <F>Ahm</F>. Last week <F>ahm</F> <.></.> on weekend, <F>ahm</F> <.></.> my friend and I decided to go to camp</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and <F>ahm</F> we prepared all the things going camping and to have meals outside, <F>ahm</F> <SC>we were</SC> <F>er</F> because we used to have campings very often <F>ahm</F> when we were students. <F>Ah</F> <F>ah</F>. Recently, we were quite busy with our work, so <F>ahm</F> we were quite looking forward to having a nice <?>and</?> a blue sky and <F>ah</F> delicious meal outside. So <R>we went <F>er</F> with</R> <F>er</F> we went with a car to Nagano Prefecture. And <F>ahm</F> at first, everything was going <R>all</R> all right. <F>Erm</F> the blue sky, the fresh air, <F>ah</F> we were quite happy with that. But <F>ahm</F> right after we finished <F>ahm</F> <F>ahm</F> building the tent, the weather <F>ah</F> changed. <F>Ah</F> <SC>it started to</SC> <F>ahm</F> <F>ahm</F> the shower started and so <F>ahm</F> I was quite worried that <SC>we wouldn't be able to have a</SC> we wouldn't <R>be</R> be able to continue camping. And I told my friend <F>ahm</F> to find some hotels. Then, my friend <F>ah</F> who knew well about Nagano Prefecture <F>er</F> told me that <F>ahm</F> she knew a nice hotel, so we decided to go to that hotel. But when we tried to <F>ahm</F> pack up all the pans and the <F>ah</F> things for the <F>ah</F> outdoor <F>er</F> cooking, <F>ahm</F> the wind <R>be</R> became very strong and we have <F>erm</F> <F>ah</F> some troubles <SC>packing in</SC> packing everything into the car. And finally <F>ahm</F> after two hours <F>ah</F> fighting with the wind, <F>ah</F> we arrived at the hotel. <F>Ah</F> the hotel was quite nice and we could have a relaxing time, but <F>ahm</F> we were quite <F>ah</F> sorry that we couldn't have <F>ah</F> <F>ahm</F> fresh air outside.</B>
