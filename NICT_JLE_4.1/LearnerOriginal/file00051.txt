<B><F>Urmm</F> <.></.> this college offered many many various opportunity to join some activities, club activity or <SC>some</SC> <F>urm</F> the other political groups or the other groups. If the student have a strong <SC>minded to</SC> <SC>activi</SC> <SC>active minded</SC> active mindness, or <SC>the people</SC> other student who <SC>have the</SC> <.></.> <F>urm</F> try to interact with other people, if the student have these kind of <R>spi</R> spirit or <F>urm</F> tried to effort, the college effort everything. But <.></.> the student <.></.> do not have <SC>the</SC> these kind of effort, <R>the</R> the college does <SC>not offer</SC> not offering anything.

But I think that this is one good aspect and <SC>they're</SC> the student face with the reality <F>urm</F> before <SC>we enter the</SC> we will enter the real world. But the university is not real world, but that <SC>af</SC> before we will enter the real world, maybe <SC>the</SC> compared with the high school student, I think that I will face with the reality. <F>Urm</F> <SC>fa</SC> meet with many many different kind of people and many good <.></.> <F>urm</F> <SC>my professor</SC> my professors so <F>mhm</F> I think that <H pn="school name1">XXX05</H> offered many various opportunity to, yeah, enjoy it.</B>

<A><F>Mhm</F>. Great. Thank you. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>,</A>
<B>Yes.</B>
<A>how has the real communication changed since you started using computer?</A>
<B><F>Urmm</F> actually, after I entered the university, I started to use e-mail. So it is very easy to communicate with the other people even if <R>they</R> they live <SC>in <R>the</R> the</SC> far from here, <SC>the</SC> not <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. So it is very easy to contact with the other people, but on the other hand, <.></.> <SC>these relationship</SC> these kind of relationship is very easy to break up. <F>Mhm</F> because <R>the</R> <.></.> the reason that <R>the</R> the <R>co</R> communicate by e-mail is very easy so it is also easy to break up. So, <F>urmm</F> after <SC>I use the computer</SC> using computer and sending e-mail, <.></.> yes, <SC>I</SC> <.></.> of course, the <.></.> <SC>communication <.></.> tool</SC> no, communication style with the other people <SC>is</SC> has changed <.></.> by using the computer.</B>
