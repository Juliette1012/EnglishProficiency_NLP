<B><F>Ahh</F> I'm working as a packaging developing assistant. And the job itself is <F>ah</F> to evaluate the packaging of the products. It is have enough strings or durability or easy to use or to check some functions of packaging.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. <F>Well</F> tell me about difficulties at work.</A>
<B><F>Ahh</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> the evaluation takes long time. And there is <R>a lot of</R> a lot of things to check. And also it takes sometimes, three months, four months time. So it's very hard to organize <R>the</R> the testing. And also we have to make <R>a</R> a lot of documents, like specification or some <?>closest</?> seat or so <F>ahh</F> I need more time <nvs>laughter</nvs> more thirty hours a day or yeah.</B>
<A>You must be really busy.</A>
<B>Yeah that's the current situation. I hope it would be improved. Yeah.</B>
<A>I hope so, too. O K. But <F>well</F> how did you spend last winter vacation?</A>
<B>Last winter vacation? I went to <R>my</R> my wife's house. And I spend just <laughter>sleep</laughter> <R>al</R> almost all the time. But it was a good time to spend with my daughter because normally, <R>week</R> weekdays I can't spend with my daughter.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> poor thing. But <F>well</F> would you tell me a bit more about your daughter?</A>
<B><F>Ahh</F>. O K. My daughter was becoming two years old <F>um</F> on thirty-first January.</B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F> really</OL>.</A>

Her name is <R><H pn="others1">XXX03</H></R> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. And she speaks a lot, but almost is meaningless. <nvs>laughter</nvs> I can't understand her saying. <OL><R>What</R> what <R>is</R> <R>is</R> is she saying</OL>?</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>.</A>
<B>But my wife can understand something because she always stays with my daughter and talks something.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>. I see. Must be cute.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>O K. <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> sounds a beautiful name.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A><R>How</R> how did you decide to give her that name?</A>
<B><R>I</R> I <R>just</R> just decide that name by the pronunciation or just <F>uh</F> <R>good</R> good hearing <SC>the</SC> verbally good <F>uh</F> yeah. <SC>We</SC> I and my wife, talked a lot about her name but <F>ahh</F> <F>ahh</F> finally <R>that's</R> that's my wife's idea. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>But I think that's a good name for her. Yeah.</B>
<A>What was your idea, then?</A>
<B><F>Ahh</F> my idea was <F>ahh</F> very strange because <R>I</R> I would like to put a name very special because if we put "Hanako" or some usual name <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I think <SC>it would be</SC> it might be her complex or some, so the special name <R>is</R> is better, I think. <CO><OL>Just my</OL></CO>.</B>

<followup>
<A>Alight. So <F>ahh</F> why do you think many apartments <SC>will</SC> <F>ahh</F> don't allow <F>ahh</F> the people to have a pet?</A>
<B><F>Ahhhh</F>. The main reason should be the noise of the bow-wow, kyan-kyan, meow, that's the main reason, I think.</B>
<A><F>Mmm</F>.</A>
<B>Because apartment has a lot of families and <F>uh</F> peoples and <R>they</R> they live separated with but the wall is a little bit thin, so the noise easily come to the other room.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
