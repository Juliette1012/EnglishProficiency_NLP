<B>My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.</B>
<A>Nice to meet you.</A>
<B>Nice meeting you.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. How are you today?</A>
<B>I'm doing fine.</B>
<A>Yes?</A>
<B>But I have a <SC?>really</SC?> <SC>slightly</SC> slight headache.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> no. <F>Mhm</F>. So <F>ur</F> will you stay at the office for a long time today?</A>
<B>I guess so. I have to because it's <F>ur</F> really busy time <OL>for us</OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <OL><F>Mh-hmm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>right now because</OL> we have a deadline coming soon.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>. I see. Can you tell me a little about what you do?</A>
<B>I'm selling advertisement to the schools overseas.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> in major English speaking countries, <F>ur</F> especially in <?>the</?> United States and Canada.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ur</F> because <F>ur</F> there is a <SC>advertise</SC> <R>ad</R> advertisement space in <R>the</R> <F>ur</F> the series of the <R>st</R> study abroad guide books</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>for Japanese students.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ur</F> so <SC>advertisers</SC> <F>ur</F> most of the advertisers are schools who is <F>ur</F> seeking for the Japanese student into their <SC>coun</SC> <F>ur</F> universities and colleges. And also language schools.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. So do you enjoy what you do?</A>
<B>I think so because I prefer to communicate with the people outside the Japan.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>.</A>
<B>So basically <SC>I li</SC> I'd like to live in <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> different countries,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>experiencing a different culture</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>and people, the way of thinking and living.</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>And that's exciting <OL>a lot</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><R>So</R> so I wish <SC>I could bou</SC> I could go back to <F>ur</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>. <F>Wow</F>. <F>Urm</F> <F>mm</F>. Can you tell me about the area you were living in in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> first <F>ur</F> three years and half, I lived in <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> like a <F>mm</F> suburban area on <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>Like <F>ur</F> twenty minutes <F>ur</F> <SC>away from</SC> <F>ur</F> north of <H pn="others2">XXX04</H></B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>by car.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And so but it's already a kind of very rural setting. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So you have to have the car</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>to live there. Otherwise you can't survive. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>So <F>urm</F> but I quite often go to <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> by train.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>But <F>ur</F> train service <SC>is</SC> <F>ur</F> yeah, is just <SC?>a one some</SC?> an hour. So and it's <R>ka</R> kind of very slow train. So it's takes nearly fifty minutes to get to the <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> <R?>ce</R?> <?>you know</?> <SC><H pn="others3">XXX05</H></SC> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. So it's not really convenient.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>. I see. So what do you like about <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> so much?</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> because <F>ur</F> it's so energetic.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>I feel energy when I step in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, <F>urm</F> immediately <R>I fee</R> I feel <R>en</R> energy of the people living there. And <F>ur</F> they are really active.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>urm</F> <F>ur</F> <SC>auk</SC> <R>als</R> also very focussed.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> many of the people <SC>s</SC> <F>ur</F> working there have <SC>their</SC> like <F>ur</F> their objectives</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>clearly.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><R>And</R> <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> and <F>ur</F> making efforts to achieve them.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>So I feel energy of those people and I like that.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. I see. <F>Urm</F> <F>mm</F>. But now you're back in Japan. <F>Mm</F>. How do you like it here?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> since this is my mother country,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>I can't say I don't like it here.</B>
<A><nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><laughter>So</laughter> it's O K to live here</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>because I'm, anyway, Japanese.</B>
<A><F>Mm</F>.</A>
<B>And my <F>ur</F> parents are also living here.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B><SC>So for them, <R>it's</R> <F>ur</F> it's</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>for them, it's really hap</SC> for them, they're very happy because <SC>I'm here</SC> I came back here and <F>ur</F> <F>urm</F> since especially because I'm a only child.</B>
<A><F>Ah-huh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> so they're really happy <F>urm</F> because I came back.</B>
<A><F>Ah-huh</F>.</A>
<B><nvs>laughter</nvs> But to me, <F>urm</F> <nvs>smack</nvs> it's <F>ur</F> not really so exciting so if I could go back to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> or maybe <SC>I</SC> now I prefer to live some country in a Europe.</B>
<A><F>Ahh</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Well</F></A>
<B><OL>Something different</OL>.</B>
<A><OL>I hope you</OL> can do that. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>

<B><laughter><nvs>laughter</nvs></laughter></B>
<A><laughter>O K</laughter>. So how do you keep yourself in healthy shape?</A>
<B>I think <R>I'm</R> I'm healthy by nature.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And I seldom get cold.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And so <F>ur</F> without doing anything, I just stay healthy.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>So but <F>ur</F> because of my age, I guess, <R>I</R> I started to gain my weight. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>So actually just yesterday, I just joined a sports club.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>

<B>It's right in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> where I'm living.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>So it's pretty close to my apartment so the accessibility is <F>ur</F> <F>urm</F> most important to me. It has to be in my vicinity</B>
<A><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.</A>
<B><OL>so that I</OL> can go there quite often <F>ur</F> even after I work.</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>And <F>ur</F> so <R>usually</R> usually I finish working like <F>ur</F> <SC>eight o'clock</SC> at eight thirty at night. So after that, even just a little bit, maybe I just go to the sports club and do some exercise for the fifteen minutes or twenty minutes, <OL><laughter>I don't know</laughter></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></A>
<B>And go home.</B>

<B><F>Ur</F> not really. Not in Japan.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>But when I was living in the United States, yes, sometimes I did.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> but it's not something really special, but just bring some cooking <F>ur</F> or <F>ur</F> sweets to the friend's house.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And like a it's a potluck party.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>

<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B><CO>So</CO>.</B>
<A>I see.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A><F>Urm</F> O K. So since you lived in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> for a while, <F>urm</F> how do you compare the way people in the States celebrate some special event and the way it's you know, celebrated here in Japan? Like birthdays or anniversaries?</A>
<B>Right. <F>Urm</F> I think American people really like to surprise people.</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
