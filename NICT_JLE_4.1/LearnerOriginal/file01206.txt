<B><F>Urm</F> it's O K <F>ur</F> as long as I stay inside. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>. But at some point, you have to go outside.</A>
<B><F>Uh-huh</F>.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ahh</F>. Usually <F>ur</F> from my house,</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>I go to the station <F>ur</F> with my husband with his driving, so I don't get <F>ur</F> rain. Then from <F>ur</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> Station to my office,</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>always they have <F>um</F> <F>ur</F> the roofs <F>uh</F> all the way</B>
<A><OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B><OL>to the office</OL>. So usually I don't have <SC>a</SC> <F>ur</F> any trouble</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> I see.</A>
<B>with raining.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>. <?>That sounds</?> nice. <F>Mm</F>. So now, <F>urm</F> could you tell me a little bit about your job?</A>
<B>O K.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> right now, I am in <JP>eigyou kaihatsu</JP> department</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>which are to <F>ur</F> the all <SC>the opening schools</SC> the new schools.</B>
<A><F>Mh-hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And for that, we have <F>er</F> a lot of documents that we have to <F>ur</F> file.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So I do that.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>And also we get many phone calls from <F>ur</F> like construction companies <R>and</R> and <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> shopping centers.</B>
<A>Right.</A>
<B>And usually I take <F>ur</F> all the phones, and <F>ur</F> take the message. <SC>And</SC> but <F>ur</F> my most favorite one <nvs>laughter</nvs> in my department is <F>uh</F> <F>urm</F> sending the newsletters about the oversea schools to all the schools in Japan. Like more than fine hundreds schools in Japan,</B>
<A><F>Uh-huh</F>.</A>
<B>I <F>ur</F> kind of make</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>newsletters, <F>ur</F> get information from overseas schools,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>and I can introduce that our company has <F>ur</F> this great network.</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B><F>Urm</F> and <F>ur</F> I'm very happy that many people read</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>that letter.</B>
<A>Right. So do you find any difficulties making that newsletter?</A>
<B>Difficulties. <OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>No, I just enjoy it.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>Yeah, I'm just enjoying making it.</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>So no difficulties. Because usually if I ask something to <SC>the</SC> our overseas schools' managers, they usually respond me very <F>ur</F> quickly so I can <F>ur</F> get information easily. Sometimes when I don't have any <F>ur</F> responses,</B>
<A><F>Ah</F>.</A>
<B>I just <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> collect information from the <F>ur</F> internet, <F>ur</F> the other websites,</B>
<A><F>Hm</F>.</A>
<B>then I read books, and then I just try to get the pictures only from the schools and I write everything <F>ur</F> by myself.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B>It's fun also.</B>
<A>Right. Right. So when you can't get the response properly,</A>
<B><F>Mm-hm</F>.</B>
<A>then what do you do?</A>
<B><F>Ur</F> <OL><R>I</R></OL></B>
<A><OL>How do you handle that</OL> situation?</A>
<B>I will <F>ur</F> send E-mail again,</B>
<A><F>Mhm</F>.</A>
<B>And I try to find somebody else at school, too. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL></B>
<A><OL><F>Oh</F></OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></A>
<B><F>Ur</F> usually managers are always <F>um</F> busy, <OL>busy, busy</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.</A>
<B>So I try to get somebody <F>uh</F> very close to <OL>the manager</OL>.</B>
<A><OL><F>Ahh</F></OL> right, right.</A>
<B>Yeah.</B>
<A>Does it work?</A>
<B>Sometimes,</B>
<A><F>Mm-hm</F>.</A>
<B>yes.</B>
<A>But sometimes it doesn't work then.</A>
<B>Sometimes nothing.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F>.</A>
<B><F>Ur</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs></B>
<A>And then <OL>what do you do</OL>?</A>
<B><OL><R>No</R> <CO>no re</CO></OL>. Then I read books and then I ask somebody else here,</B>
<A>I see. <OL>Right</OL>.</A>
<B><OL><SC>which</SC></OL> <F>ur</F> <F>um</F> <F>ur</F> who has been</B>
<A><F>Hmm</F>.</A>
<B>to that school.</B>
<A><F>Oh</F> yeah. I see. So it's <??></??> difficult</A>

<B>O K.</B>
<A>So please describe it.</A>
<B>O K. <F>Ur</F> <SC>it'a very</SC> it's sunny day. And <F>ur</F> this is <F>ur</F> a residence area. And I can see a big house and two dogs are in front of the house and two kids are playing balls. And <F>ur</F> one girl is enjoying the jumping rope. And there is one car <F>ur</F> on the street in front of the house. And a cat is sleeping on it. And two women are talking on the street. One of them has a dog. And there is a man <F>ur</F> jogging on the street. And also across the house, <F>ur</F> one man is reading <F>ur</F> newspaper, sitting on the bench. And all of them look very happy.</B>

<A>please compare the neighborhood in this picture to the one you live now.</A>
<B><F>Mhm</F>. <F>Ur</F> this area, I think <F>ur</F> the people living there have more money than we do because that it's a big house and also they have a big yard. <F>Ur</F> but my area, <F>uh</F> many houses, and the street is not big like this. And <F>ur</F> more houses in <F>ur</F> the small space. And let's see, this is <F>urm</F> the day time, right? But usually I leave house in the morning, and I come home late. And usually on the weekend, <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> my husband and I try to go somewhere else.</B>
